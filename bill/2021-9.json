As in, the store will be completely empty, then someone comes in, and within about five minutes, 2-3 other people or groups come in after them. Separate groups. From different entrances. Coming in within minutes of each other. CONSISTANTLY. Then they clear out around the same time too. Groups that are NOT TOGETHER. NOT COMMUNICATING. NOT TRAVELING TOGETHER. and yet they are. It's almost totally predictable (there are outliers). And i get that sometimes there are other factors, like the bus stopped here, or it's after the lunch rush and everyone is coming after eating, or there's construction outside bringing people this way, or things like that. But I am not aware of any of that happening. And it's like, are they coordinating, talking to each other on l ittle walkie talkies? No! They're just doing it naturally, some how. Is there some other reason that I'm missing? Or do we humans just have some kind of subconscious magnetism to each other??",

With quarantine, things just got worse and it honestly feels like I'll never find my way out of this place, out of their influence. I'm about to turn 18 and next year I should be heading to college. However, I can't go anywhere out of state because my parents say they won't pay for it, but they do have the money to do so, which means I can't apply for any financial aid. So I'm basically an adult now, but I can't begin to act like one because I have neither money nor a car or anything. I've just wanted to break free for as long as I can remember, and for the last few years I kept myself studying hard considering that'd provide for me, it would give me a way out. But now that the time has actually come for me to go to college, and I realize I don't have any passions anymore and the only thing that's left is a escape, which it won't provide either. Everyday I h ear more sarcastic comments about how everything I do is flawed and I'm never enough and I just don't want to keep doing this, taking everything they say to me. And I genuinely can't see this going on for more 5 years or so, till I finish college and get a job, without me completely falling apart. I just don't know how long I'll be able to hold on. I feel hopeless. Do you happen to have any kind words?",

That doesn't mean i know exactly how the song will sound before i produce it, and it doesn't stop me from feeling empty sometimes at the start of production, but, what's most important is that i do know exactly how the song goes. there's already enough unknowns in the production process details, even after knowing the song"
