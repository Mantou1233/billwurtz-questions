For the key of the song and/or the chord of the current measure, I visualize the shape given by the major scale that corresponds with that chord as numbers from 1-7 (along with 9,11,13 I guess, and also stuff like #5, b3, etc.), and so those numbers go on different keys/frets depending on the key/current chord.

Gradually, when you're ready, add another note to the notes you know. just learn what the notes sound like, 1 note at a time, and let them gradually assimilate themselves into your repetoire. the darn thing happens pretty much automatically the more time you spend around the instrument"

This actually won't take care of the entire song, because if you only do sprinkles, you will usually never end up getting the important mainstays like the kick and bass, etc, but, it is a good technique nonetheless. it is particularly exciting when you do sprinkles first, before doing anything else. by the way this only works if you've written the song first before you start recording it, and have the exact road map"

            "why is it so much easier to start a new song than to continue one?? it's driving me crazy. you'd think continuing something would be easier than coming up with something from scratch, but no.\ni'm guessing you're going to answer with \"try making shorter songs\", but that doesn't solve the problem because it doesn't train the skill of coming up with \"the next part\" of a song. i think learning to play already existing songs on an instrument could help train that intuition, what do you think about that?",
            "here's what happened to me. when i was at your stage, one solution is to just finish it in 1 session. i was writing entirely on paper at that time. but i soon got tired of that method (it's a good method, but it results in some pretty mentally insane songs, with all due respect to mental insanity), and i also came up with a lot of choruses, verse fragments, or just intros, and didn't know how or WHEN to deal with them. but here's what i eventually did: i went through all my notes and collected every song or song fragment i had ever written or worked on. and i put them all into a list in chronological order. Then, i just started at the beginning of the list, and 'find the next thing' or, just 'answer the next question' on each of them, before moving onto the next one. this unfortunately would take infinite years, so i shuffled things up a little and did a percentage completion system, etc etc, but still had ways of selecting which one i was doing next. nowadays i'm selecting to record, which means whichever one i select, could be a fragment, is the one i will record. so that puts me in a situation of writing for the recording which is about to happen. I guess what i'm trying to say is, the selection process is so important because if you are not confident about the validity of your selection, then you will run away from the song. So i guess the selection is one half of the challenge. then there's just techniques to do once you're there and you're already sure you're working on the right song, now what do you do? Well it's a lot like being a doctor. you just have to ask good questions. First thing i would check, is, 'is this the beginning', like, does the piece you have belong at the beginning of the song, or in the middle, is it the chorus, etc etc. If it clearly belongs absolutely at the total beginning, then, the process is pretty simple. Just run it through, and stop playing at the end of what you have, and wait for lightning to strike. Then if it doesn't, ask as many questions as you can about what you think you might have been about to hear.... Then what i do, for a re-set, is i walk over and touch the door handle, and come back and run it again from the top, and do the same thing again. It's extremely important that you run it AT TEMPO (at the right tempo) because often what we do in songwriting if we're trying to think of ideas, we run the bit before, over and over and we start doing it faster, which will trick you into then writing things at the wrong tempo and it won't fit with the rest. so make sure all your run throughs are at tempo. it's good to get on the metronome as soon as you can, to preserve, because songwriting is a time warp and it can make things change speed when you didn't mean to. But i didn't mention what to do if the piece you have is NOT the beginning. in this case you are going to have to do a weird backwards puzzle to figure out what comes before. It's almost impossible to figure out what comes before something, actually. one weird trick which might be semi-reliable is to run the chorus and see if you can get a second verse, and then hope that one of the things around there also makes sense as an intro, but at least for me writing backwards is almost impossible"

So the fear was that some terribly unexpected stuff may happen around the world as a result of all the computer systems suddenly thinking it's 1900, instead of 2000. there was a widespread fear that everything would break down. but luckily, through hard work i think, most of the important systems managed to get fixed in time, so there really wasn't any huge catastrophe. This issue was known as the \"Y2K\" issue, but besides that, Y2K was actually just a nickname for the year 2000. so essentially, Y2K means the year 2000. hope that helps"

My personal short hand for the chord you are talking about is E-sus11 (Emin sus11) however this is NOT something that you can use on a public chart and expect anyone to know what you are talking about, because it does not conform to any kind of standards that anyone knows. sus11 is something i made up, and you can't count on anyone guessing what you mean if you write that. i just use it because i use that all the time (actually with no E in the harmony, just in the bass), and another way of writing that is also Gsus2/E or maybe you could get away with G2/E (in case G2 is accepted as Gsus2 which it may or may not be). also it seems important to prioritize E in the chord symbol to make it plainly clear that this is acting like some kind of E minor chord, because anything else will make the reader have to pause and do some calculations. but as i said earlier, the only way to really do this is exactly the way you said it (add this, minus that, etc) and the reader will definitely have to do some calculations there as well",

            "hi bill, your keyboard playing is very inspiring;do you have any tips on how to practice hand independence? it feels quite overwhelming as a process, i'm not exactly sure on how to babystep my way into that. thabks",
            "this is actually a relationship for more than 2. your right hand, your left hand, your voice, another person as the bass player, another singer, another person as a guitar/keyboard player, ...... Check around your ensemble (maybe just you) and tally up HOW MANY of those items are in your ensemble. (i listed 6 things, now that i count them). And now, keep in mind that there are maybe only THREE ROLES that those must play, IN TOTAL. not each. Basically it's 3 jobs to do. so think about how many people/things are doing them. If the amount of things/people doing the jobs is more or less than 3, then there will have to be some interesting agreements made. everyone probably can't/shouldn't do all 3 at the same time, unless they are very very coordinated with each other. And yet, on the other hand, if there's only 2 things/people, they will have to juggle the 3 roles. the 3 roles are bass, melody, chords. So let me give you some examples, and my point is that your hands have different jobs depending on the personell situation. so for example: let's say it's just you. and let's say you are using both hands and your voice. that's pretty clear, your left hand takes the bass, your right hand takes the chords mostly, and your voice takes the melody. Well, imagine, instead, that you already have a bass player in the band, and let's say you are NOT singing. In that case, the bass player plays the bass, and YOU will be playing NOT the bass, but the melody and chords -- probably 1 with each hand. This is an entirely different configuration because now you are playing chords with your left hand. Let's imagine a different situation-- let's say you are playing with no bass player, you are not singing, but you have another person who is the singer. In this case, you will be doing bass in left hand and chords on right. Let's look at another example: if it's you on keyboard, and someone else on guitar, and the guitar player is singing. Well, the 2 of you need to come to an agreement and one of you should take care of the bass, and the other should take care of the chords. An important hint is that there should not be more than 1 person taking care of the bass (unless it is written EXACTLY, AND if it's neccesary to be full of BEEF at that particular moment.-- this will only be good for a non-musical sound effect / rumble sound. will not really work musically/tonally.) Also the other combination i forgot to mention is, if you are playing piano by yourself with no other players and not using your voice-- in that case, you will be dividing the 3 roles amongst only TWO players (your 2 hands) so in that case, you sort of have to magically somehow juggle the 3 of them.So, between different combinations of bass, chords, melody, ... and the players: your left hand, your right hand, and your voice, there are many different combinations for what jobs your hands are going to play. So it's important to take a moment to notice which of these scenarios you are in. And beyond that, the strategy is essentially the same, which is to use your imagination and try to play songs in any possible way you can, because someone's gotta do it"
