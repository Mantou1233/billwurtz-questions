            "I'm sure you've gotten this question before but I don't understand the difference between 3/4 and 6/8 (time signatures)? Is it just the triplets? People (music teachers) always seem to emphasize how it's important that we know they're different but they never actually explain what the difference is.",
            "a mathematical guideline for time signatures, supposedly, is that the top number is how many beats per bar, and the bottom number is what note is a beat. So, by that logic, 2/4 means 2 beats per bar, and a 4th note (quarter note) gets 1 beat. By the same logic, 7/2 (as if anyone ever uses that, which they don't) would mean 7 beats per bar, and a Half note gets one beat. But, here's the thing: usually, in actual reality, when the bottom number is 8, the eighth notes are usually going by too fast to actually 'feel' like a beat. But by the sheer logic of the 'beats' rule as described earlier, 6/8 *would* mean, 6 beats per bar, and the 8th note gets one beat. But, almost always, in actual reality, 6/8 is actually fast enough that it's actually felt as if the dotted quarter note gets the beat. So that would make it 2 beats per bar, and 3 8th notes per beat. So really, to properly follow the system, that would mean your top number should be 2, and the bottom number should be...um.... some kind of decimal (let me perform some calculations)... the bottom number would have to be about 2.6667. So really, in actually reality, the way 6/8 is usually felt, it should more accurately be called 2/2.667. But that would cause chaos all over society, so it's not written that way. But getting back to the difference between 3/4 and 6/8-- if you set your metronome to 120bpm, and count in groups of 3 clicks, let's say that's 3/4 at &#9833;=120. Now set the metronome to 80bpm, and count in groups of 2 clicks, and subdivide each beat into 3, so like imagine you are counting 8th note triplets in 2/4. 3 triplets per beat, 2 beats per bar. but, plot twist, imagine the small notes are actually 8th notes, and you are living in a universe where there is 3 8th notes per beat, and each beat is a dotted quarter note. This is what it would feel like to be in 6/8, and the tempo marking would be &#9833;. = 80. In 6/8 (or 12/8) the tempo marking is often marked in terms of a dotted quarter note. So anyway, to conclude, this is not written in any 'rule', but this is just the way it is in the real world -- 6/8, 12/8, and often 9/8, are counted as if the beat is happening on dotted quarter notes. again, the reason being that no one wants to write 2/2.667. And, you may be thinking, why not just put the song in 2/4 and use triplets, or maybe just 4/4, and use triplets. And this is a valid argument, and like i always say, when you are faced with a song with some kind of triplet or quick 3 feel, you just have to ask yourself whether you would prefer to be writing a lot of dots (for all the 'regular' beats which will have to be dotted) OR a lot of the number 3 (for all the triplets). It's a personal decision, and the more you get out there and see the kind of charts that are circulating in your world or community, you can make the decision based on what you think would be most familiar to your reader(s)"

Then the recording process becomes a fun adventure for how you are going to deliver the song, and you already know the agenda for every part (every bar, not instrument) of the song. forgive me if you already do this. if you have, then my answer would be different"

When it comes time to make your music, you must do it exactly according to your own wildest dreams. But before that, on a different day maybe, in a different season, in a totally different section of the building, you were just casually listening to music that other people might like, purely for the hopes of finding more things that YOU like. This really has nothing to do with the 'making music' part, the listening is actually just for enjoyment. When it comes time to make the music, actually you might as well try to do something you like that sounds totally different from anything else you've heard before. or the same. it's irrelevant whether it's different or the same. but the important thing is when it comes time to make the music you have to do it the way you like. So you may be thinking, \"so, you're saying i should just make the music i like and it doesn't matter if anyone else likes it\" No, that's still not quite what i mean. what i mean is, making music that you really fully like is probably the ONLY reliable way TO actually guarantee that others will like it. Now still, you may also be thinking \"so what are the benefits of trying to make music that you DON'T like, but you THINK others will like.\" Well, i think i can safely say that this does not actually get anyone to like it, but, this is where the confusion arises, it might make OTHER people THINK that someone ELSE may like it. so that's good for a free lunch somewhere maybe, but it will be a lousy lunch and does not compare to the lifetime of grade A lunches you can get if you ultimately just cut out the middle man and make the music you know is best"

You may have assumed it means \"add9\", but if it's add 9, it really shouldn't say + because that is a symbol for augmented, and also, because it was Bm7, it also includes the 7, and \"add9\" usually means you add 9 without having the 7. where as if you wanted to keep the 7 it would be just Bm9. Also, possibly, this confusion could have been avoided by saying Bm7(#9). But according to my best reasoning, i determined that it was nearly 100% likely that the person meant aug9 or sharp9 and not 'add 9', based on all the charts i have seen throughout my life time"

These night walks are helpful for making my head feel better, But it doesn't seem all good. i get this really demanding nagging tension to keep doing More, and if i don't i'm gonna be a timid weakling who comes in last forever etc. Right now  it want s me to run through the entire grounds. It doesn't seem like it ends. you just feed it and then it wants more. So the thing about the nice 'i can walk outside and do whatever i want\" feeling from goin' trespassing is it's fun and then i come down and am faced with The Usual(my ugly face and shit brain that wants to hurt me). I do a lot of music and words and started drawing recently. those are the things i REally care about, in a nice way. the things i think can save me. I'm not sure what i'm trying to ask. I guess i won't die getting caught walking around a country club and my brain plays up the actual stakes as high as it can. but that would feel so unbelievably stupid For a While after dealing with cops and paying whatever that way too big fine would be. it's like a distraction but it has legitimacy cause of how big and deep the nice feeling is after, if only for a minute. But then there is all the bad feeling inbetween. I guess i question how helpful it is vs how dumb it  is. i'v e been talking it out with myself and im struggling to deal with these feelings and what i should do about them",
