Usually, I follow the same kinda mindset as you've said before of \"trying to fit the chord/instrumentation that supports the melody/song at the time\" (I think, it's been a while!) But I haven't been able to ever make a trill on either a brass instrument or a piano or keyboard to sound anything but really really jarring against the rest of the song... In your song \"this is a song for my next album\" you end the song with a really excellent trill on a keyboard that just Feels So Natural to the rest of the track! I absolutely know that I should be looking to find the instrumentation that supports the track as best as possible rather than Trying To Fit something that doesn't belong (as like forcing yourself to shoehorn a particular chord) but I feel like at this point there's just something that I'm fundamentally missing with my execution of a trill that always leads to it clashing Every Time. Any ideas on what might be my issue, or any tips that might help point me in the right direction? Thanks!",

            "the 'graphics' phase was finished on feb 7. after that, the process is a little bit more confusing to explain. it's a lot of smaller things -- final narration, jingle vocals, editing jingles and narration, mixing, re-alignment to fit final narration timing, and the score. the score is the most subtantial item of all of those, but not as large as 'graphics.' it is hard to exactly explain the process because i have been bouncing around depending on whether it's day or night (vocal recording, etc) and also i was sick and had lingering sick voice for a couple weeks, so during that time i made an early detour into doing the score, somewhere around feb 19. so i basically locked up the narration timing up until 7:50 (that was as far as i had gotten) and started on the score. by the time i reached 7:50 in the score (this was around march 2 i guess), i was able to resume vocals, and was bouncing around between doing jingles and narration.  narration is now solidly in place with correct timing, video re-alignment to fit that new timing is done, now starting on the rest of the score, from 8min to the end. once the score is done, it is just the small little tasks like year labels, other labels, graphics adjustments, mixing, etc etc etc but these small tasks tend to fly by very fast, and once the score is done it tends to be a slippery slope to the end of the process. this is what i know from experience on doing the previous long video of this type. i hope that makes sense"

I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several alignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i \"save as\" and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and alignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to somehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in getting a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start"
