            "ah, as you can see, i think this perfectly illustrates why it is best to wait at least a year or two before composing the reality videos. those ones you saw, those were probably composed within a month or two of the original recording, and so i didn't have the proper perspective to know that the idea of doing an album was a very fleeting idea. looking at it now, seeing the big picture, at least the way i feel about it now, music albums don't work for me and they've never worked for me. whenever i receive music on an album, for some reason i always think i hate all the songs. but whenever i receive songs individually, there is a much higher chance i will like and appreciate that 1 song. i can't remember exactly why i thought an album would be a good idea at that time. but my point is that if i were assembling reality videos from that time period, now, i would obviously skip all the stuff where i am talking about making an album, so that way i wouldn't have to explain how or why i changed my mind",

            "i have never had a good experience with an album. i think it's just too many new songs to digest at one time. it seems very fatiguing and it always seems like there's nothing good on the album. where as if those songs were released individually, in most cases i probably would have liked almost all of them. it is still my belief that songs are not at their strongest when grouped together with several other songs and no other connecting tissue such as visual or story or both, or more. in other words, what i'm saying is, and i'm sure i have said it here 100 times before, i think the key to making albums be the best they can be would be to make it so much more than an album that it would no longer be considered an album"

'absolute pitch' might be a slightly clearer name for it. absolute pitch is mostly not at all what gives music its power. nearly 100% of the power of music comes from the relative relationships between pitches. and the good news is that those can be mastered at later ages, although it still helps to start young but it's not a deal breaker if you don't. where as with absolute pitch, you really can't get there unless you have it locked in by age 6. but as i said before, absolute pitch is hardly important for excellent musicianship, and might even be misleading or distracting"

When I'm in the process of adding notes to the chord, there are definitely some that are obviously not present in the chord. Other notes however sound \"good\" but I wonder if they are actually there or are just \"compliant\" with the chord and are effectively coloring it in a way that sounds nice. As for not having enough notes in the chord, that is a mystery to me. Maybe that problem isn't as bad though because at a certain point you've gone through all the notes in the scale allotted to that chord in a certain range of the piano and hopefully any significantly lower/higher duplicates of those notes would be obvious to pick out.",

'stuck in a rut' the audio recording was made in 2005. it definitely wasn't put on itunes until at least 2015, because i didn't have the abilitiy to put things on itunes until then. but i hopefully dated it correctly, based on when it was made (2005). as of 2005 and the many years before that, i was fully capable of writing and recording instrumental music, but the whole 'words' part of it was really not figured out yet. 'i'm stuck in a rut' was essentially all i could fathom at that time. although meanwhile i was going absolutely bonkers via text editors. which i recommend to anyone who is trying to figure out which way is which. my strategy in general was to see if i could deconstruct the entire universe and how it works. that was just the only way i could get my head around the full game of songwriting, including any and all musical/linguistical things i thought i could and might be capable of. somewhere around 2009 i think i found myself ready to get into the full songwriting game, but it still took a few more years after that to get the recording schemes, and the writing schemes, further organized. videos, is yet an entirely separate piece of the puzzle which i had to sort of put together from scratch .... which i am actually doing again now, as it turns out"
