And the reason the word 'liar' is there is, clearly, it's what follows naturally after the line \"when i get younger\". Because obviously no one's gonna get younger. so obviously if you say you've gotten younger then you're presumably a liar. And the way the \"when i get younger\" line comes about, is, just a simple songwriting tactic of taking the already established first line (\"when i get older\") and choosing the natural alternative options. older --> younger. So you can see, the whole existence of the word 'truthful' in that verse is clearly the result of a very logical chain of songwriting best-practices"

By placing this in 1900, it's giving you an alternate view of the same story from an earlier point in time, and it also gives you the listener the sensation of actually being in the future, as you are listening to it more than 100 years later. so it hopefully rings especially true that times did change and indeed still are"

I'm going through a song, looking at it's chords to get a better understanding of it and I want to go through and write the roman numerals and type (maj, min, dim, etc) so like I-ii-V-vi etc etc. Problem is, this is one of those songs that doesn't sit neatly in major or minor. It has one flat, starts on a D minor chord but resolves most of the time to F major, however, it resolves to a D minor at the very end. So, to the point, do I write the numerals in terms of the minor key (i-ii°-III-iv-v-VI-VII) or the major key (I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii°)? Thanks so much",
