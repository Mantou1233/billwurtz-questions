            "You might be asked like thirty times before you write a response but in case you haven't, Vine had just announced that they are discontinuing their service in the coming months. They'll keep old videos online. I remember back before History of Japan you were kinda in a love-hate relationship with Vine because it allowed you to trim and really concentrate your content, but doing so was kinda addicting(?) in a way and it sorta stagnated you from making longer videos until you made the bold move to cut Vine off entirely during HoJ production. I'm sorry if this question seems to be spiraling out of control or maybe I'm just rambling, but I'm curious to understand why Vine was an appealing outlet for your content at the time and if you've \"grown out\" of it and don't mind the discontinuation too much or if you still have some fondness for that service. Thanks for reading, regardless!",
            "i was already making short videos (because it was a good way to get used to making videos), and about a year into it i found out there was a popular platform where the videos were supposed to be short, and they are auto-looped. so it seemed like a good decision to try to get the videos onto there. by the time i actually got most of them on there i was really getting ready to get Off the 5-day schedule and start looking at longer stuff. but then the popularity kicked in on vine (but still not so much on yt because vine doesn't let you put links to anywhere!!), so i had to do more short ones, just when i was really ready to do longer ones. so i had to sort of bend over backwards to condense the 7 day vine production down to as quick as possible to have enough time to try some long stuff, and after 3 months i finally finished one which actually did very well, and within a couple weeks i was doing better outside of vine than on vine. so by that point, not only have i made 200 more short videos than i ever really intended to, now i have a whole new audience which actually gets mad at me for doing short videos. so that's 2 reasons it's time to shift. don't get me wrong, i will still do things of all lengths and types. the original reason i did short things is because i like to do things of all different lengths, and i always wrote things of all different lengths, but the short ones are the quickest to produce, so i always fell into the trap of producing the short ones first, early on, because it is really the only way to get started"

            "actually no. being forced to work fast  is actually a huge blessing. creativity is so flexible, it is amazing the kind of decisions that you make when you have a deadline-- corners you cut, that you never would have dreamed of cutting if u had no deadline, but under pressure you make crazy decisions and your mind instantly gravitates toward the fast choices, and it also encourages you to gravitate toward more exciting choices to make up for the fact that you can't care delicately for every little thing. an example of one of my most intense time-crunches would be the babies-grownups-babies video. i took so many short cuts, and i was just throwing things in there so fast, and I was almost late for work (i am not telling you what my job is)but in the end, no one is complaining and look at all the stuff i have gotten done.given the demonic flexibility of the creative process, i am really feeling like i never want to work off-deadline again. i mean, I have been working off deadline on this current video for more than 4 months, and i THINK i'm going as fast as i can, but at the same time the video is much less than half done and i still have barely even gotten to the production. this is no way to live. i have a lot of stuff to do, songs, videos, so many things left to do and the years are going to fly by if i don't set some more insane deadlines. which is why i have recently set a deadline for the current video, which is completely unreasonable, and yet it is the best thing that has ever happened to me because it is making me get back into serious mad-crunch mode, which brings a much needed thrill to the never ending landscape of uncertainty of when this thing will ever be done"
