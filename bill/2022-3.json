            "I know you often say it's best to write the music and the lyrics at the same time. but what should I do if I have a pretty good idea of what the melody and so on should be, but I just can't think of the what words to go with it? like I know what I want to *say* (like the actual emotions and ideas that I want to express), I just can't think of any words that fit. the emotions and thoughts are all slippery and blobby and I can't get them into any actual specific words without them all disappearing and blobbing together again somewhere else.\n and I know that music can help with that (words alone can say some things but not others, music alone can say some things but others, so if you put them together you can say more things together than you could with either thing alone, right?) but I still can't work out what actual words I should put into this thing, it's so annoying.\nbut anyway you are I think good at having words that go well with music in a wa y that is more than the sum of its parts, so do you know any magic secret advice? or even just any idea what to do here?\nor am I thinking about this all wrong",
            "you are thinking about it right. but actually, the problem here is that these things usually only get solved when you're not thinking about it. Which is almost impossible, because you really want this, so you're obviously gonna think about it. but just trust that it will happen. Paraphrasing what you feel it should say, that's good, and you're already doing that. Sometimes it's good to just start trying things, and get all the way through the lines. Sometimes if you're searching for the right thing, you never let yourself finish any lines, because you think it's not right. Start trying complete lines, that actually make it all the way to the end of the line, with words. Finish the line anyway, even if you don't think it's right. and then try different entire lines. Don't be afraid to bend the rhythm to fit the words you're using, if it helps you get to the end of the lines. Also another way to make things come alive is by jolting it into a slightly 'wrong' way. Then again, there might actually be a 'perfect' unjolted right way that you've been wishing for, but that will probably only come to you when you completely stop trying, like in a dream or something. which you can't really plan for"

Quick decay means the note will disappear almost immediately after you press it, even if you hold the note down. only short notes allowed. dinks and donks. Long decay (or infinite) means the note will stay on as long as you hold the note.\n'release' is what happens when you let go of the note. Quick release means the note will stop as soon as you let go of the note. Slow release means the note will ring out for a long time after you let go (like a ringing bell).\n'cutoff', also called 'filter cutoff' is like a wawa pedal, if you've ever heard one of those. try saying \"wawawawa\"... this is probably what it would sound like if you hold a note and move the cutoff knob up and down.

            "i have 2 stories. one is about the way it was selected, and the other story is about the chorus almost being cancelled. For the song selection, i was using my standard song selection technique, which is to go through all my potential songs, and pick the ones i'm most excited about doing, and put them in a list. i came up with about 30 choices. THEN, this is where i made the mistake: i went around that final list a second time, to try to remove the ones i don't really want, and be left with only the best. The problem is, one by one i found reason to eliminate all of them. Maybe some of them felt too similar to a recent song.... maybe some of them felt too slow... maybe some of them felt too fast.... maybe some were too happy... maybe some of them felt like they would be too boring.... maybe some of them felt like they would be too crazy.... But i eliminated every single one. This is not what's supposed to happen. this is a fear driven situation i found myself in. Really, the important thing to remember when doing the song selection, is that truly any choice can work. Because most of the writing is still ahead, and the entire production is still ahead, and any song, if it's made it to that first list, it has more than good enonugh potential to be turned into something great. But here i was, being so particular that i had actually removed every song from the list. So, in a fit of rage, i un-removed all of them, and very quickly chose one that seemed like the weakest one, which was only 1 line at the time (\"just did a bad thing\"). Not knowing anything else about that song, which way it could go, not knowing what the 'bad thing' is, ... but it seemed to relate to the situation at hand, and i knew the antidote to this conundrum would be to choose something on a whim that was mostly unknown, just like this one. so that's why i made that choice. then i continued the writing from there, using my standard songwriting procedures and practices. The story behind the first chorus (the \"game\" section), is this: When i first launched into that section (coming up with half or maybe all of it), i was excited to have something like this, but then after a few more play-throughs i started to feel like that section really doesn't belong in this song. So i actually filed that away as a different song, and tried to continue forward (from 'cancelled') to see what else i can do instead. What else i found wasn't any better, so i eventually had to decide that the \"game\" section is the best option"

            "Hi William. I've been working for the last 5 years of my life in a concept album (much like how Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" was an album, but also it was more than just that. It was a movie, and a live show, and a compendium of ideas paired with music and visuals). But now, as I find myself at the last stretch of the process, I can't help but feel guilt at how long this all took. I wish a could have done this faster, but maybe it was just the way that it needed to be made. I'm currently having severe panic attacks thinking that maybe this project didn't turn out to be that good and I just wasted the past 5 years of my life. Any thoughts on this? I was thinking that maybe you felt this way when you were at the last stretch of making \"History of Japan\" or \"History of the entire world, i guess\". If that's the case;How did you dealt with that feeling? How can I push through this last stretch of the process and finally finish the thing without failing? Thanks  Bill.",
