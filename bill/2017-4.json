He's riding on a train (on his way to prison) and he's hungry for food and women (he's not gonna see a woman again any time soon) 5. He talks about \"loving the shade of those license plates\" i.e. he's making license plates, a stereotypical prison job.My theory is that he loved his daughter and went crazy before killing her and his nervous breakdown only got worse as he got sentenced to life in prison so he wrote this song to say what he wants to tell his dead daughter whom he loved dearly. As he's \"talking\" to his daughter, he feels the need as a father to protect her from the truth, and \"lies about details\" by saying he's \"actually going to connecticut\"At first he tries to convince himself that it's all for the better and that he's happy, evidenced by how he says he hopes the train doesn't get derailed, and how \"the season is winter, and the sky is so blue\" but gradually comes back to reality and understands the severity of the situation, as line \"it's summer and the sky has turned grey and my dreams are sailing away\" indicates he has spent enough time in prison for the seasons to change.

Also, a new type of test, which unfortunately is now a reality, is the bassless test. listen to your song on a device which has fucking no bass (such as the built in speakers on a smartphone, tablet, watch, whatever.) and no, you will not hear any bass, but it may add some perspective as to how to make sure the song still stands, in a bassless world, which weirdly enough is becoming more commonplace. and yet, systems with bass are still widespread, and the game is entirely different depending on whether you have bass or not. but you need to make sure your song succeeds in both games. It's like writing a TV show, but then when you're done you have to make sure the show also makes sense if you delete one of the characters. weird, but i guess it's a fun challenge. i have actually never really done the bassless test for a song, too afraid to admit its importance. but it is important and i will do it in the future. for fucks sakes they used to make records on balls of wax, and they liked it"
