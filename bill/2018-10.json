The first part is incredibly somber and quite frankly depressing, exuding the feeling of exhaustion and trying to trick yourself into going forward (maybe this is just my personal experiences with depression and feeling desperate to keep moving, but the three lines about how far you've gone and then with the \" and it's a long long long long long way back\" to me feels more like a reminder that you can't change your mind now. Instead of being encouraging and motivating, to me it feels daunting and frightening that now you kind of have to keep going forward since you cant go back.) \n\nRegardless of the first bits, the second part se ems to t ake a more positive outlook, especially with the last line with the \"road\" being to success. My best guess is that this song is about struggling to stay either motivated with a project or with life in general, that or it could be about depression and a kind of subliminal encouragement to those suffering that it DOES get better if you keep fighting.
