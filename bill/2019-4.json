This has been a huge help for me because I'm starting to be very encouraged by a huge growing library, and also starting to see some patterns and directions in all these little ideas, and all this helps me come up with new ideas to fill in the gaps. The part that I'm having trouble with though is the part where I'm supposed to work on a song and \"don't switch to a different one until you've made significant progress\"? Another fun issue that I've been dealing with for years, is re-writing songs.

But I dont know if it's bothering me because i know i should feel bad about not having an entirely original video aesthetic or if the word just doesnt seem fair to others who are doing their best with tools.Making the music takes time, making the videos takes time, somehow this way of making videos just feels so intuitive.Like it's the most effective and efficient way to make content that is of some quality. I'm not sure how to feel about it.Would you advise me to steer clear of this way of editing?I get a bit panicky when I think of turning up the different dial because I dont know how to conceptualize another video style that feels like it has quality to it but doesnt take forever to make (using only my simple tools).Am I screwed?Part of me does feel bad because I feel like if I'm good enough I should know what to do about this problem.",

THEY ASK FOR THE MANUALS BACK. nobody told me that would happen and the manuals have always been ours to keep at every other certification i've ever attended. so it's like, do i return this and never train with the first aid company again (i have very distinctive handwriting that matches the handwriting on my registration form), or covertly try to steal the manual? i tried the  latter  but a classmate saw and gave me a dirty look so i ended up returning it and shoving it into the middle of the pile. i still don't know whether that was the correct decision.\n\nmy worst fear is that the next person reading that manual won't realize the anagrams are in fact anagrams, and will just think i wrote \"boner juice slut, join me and sin\" over the chapter title for no reason. anyway what would the best course of action have been? do you have any advice for future similar instances of this? thanks",
