For example, if the chart of a song has a IV chord, would a I11 chord work over the IV in most situations? If you throw a major 6th into a I11 chord, that would esssentially make it a IVmaj9.",
            "where i come from, \"11\" usually only is used on minor chords. i don't quite see how your example adds up. in C assuming you mean 1,3,5,7,9,11 (which mostly no one would do, i'm not sure if you meant#11? or is it a minor chord all along?) and then you add a 6, that doesn't really make Fmaj9. anyway, it's not too good to think about it this way. just use the notes you need to support the melody, then afterwards you can argue about what to put on the page. Sounds like you are a bit goal oriented on using the number 11 on the page, and that might not be a good way to look at it. A useful example of something that might end up being called \"11\" is let's say it's the key of C, melody note is G, and it's a Dmin7 chord. in reality you might play C,F,G(notes) in the chord, and call it Dmin11 if you want. Or let's say you are in the key of Cmin and it's just a Cmin vamp for a while and you've got a melody that is focusing on the F note. then you might use F,D,Bb notes in your chord, with the Eb tucked in there too. or more likely even, oscilating between a Bb triad and Eb triad in the chord. similarly in the relative major version of that, in the key of Eb, you might see a F note on a Cmin chord, and the chordal player will play Bb triad (over C) first, before swicthing to the Eb triad (Cmin7). all these things might be called 11. but to be honest it's not too necessary to really use the number 11 when talking about chords, it's kind of confusing, and the way it's taught as a stack of 3rds up to 11 is a bit confusing and does not really represent most musical realities. because a full stack up to 11 would have 6 notes, and most chords have less than 6 notes, so most chords being called '11' wont really have all the notes. also stacking it from the bottom up is not something that normally happens in reality outside of a music textbook or class. usually when you see 11 on the page it just means that the melody note is a 4th above the bass. and the remaining notes are chosen sensibly for the situation. i hope that makes sense"

So let's get our F, that's gonna be a true 5th down from C, right? now A should be a pure major third above F, for sure. and B should surely be a pure major 3rd above G. now what should D be? you would assume that it would be a pure ninth from C (i.e. the frequency times 9 and then divided back down the octaves) which is good for the G chord also because it will be a 5th away from G. looks great, so now you've got C, D, E, F, G, A, B. but what you find next might come as a shock. D minor sounds like a nightmare. because D to A is supposed to be a 5th and now it is a very very wrong 5th. because you tuned your A to be a harmonically pure major 3rd away from F. no matter how you slice it, you inevitably run into the same argument where a 3rd needs to be a purely harmonic 3rd, but also needs to be a series of 5ths. i juggled the possibilities all around for at least a day, and i was completely stunned to find out that the essence of music, and specifically the way the \"secondary\" notes (let's say in a major key, the secondary notes are D, F, A, and also G, and the primary notes are C,E,G. that's right, G is both, the universe is a love paradox, get used to it) the secondary notes need equal tempered tuning to work right. there are surely many different ways to look at this and i made up the primary and secondary classifications for this example, but the point is that there will always be overlap. you will never have 2 exclusive sets of notes. it stems from the fact that the D note needs to be able to relate to G, but also needs to relate to the A, but the A also needs to relate to the F, and the F also definitely needs to relate to the C. now you might say \"ok, tune them differently depending on what chords you're using.\" but that really doesn't work right, because music needs all these notes to coexist. you're not going to just expect that Dmin and Fmaj will never need to blend together with the A held over. or that Dmin and Gmaj will never need to blend together with the D held over. At the end of this mind exploding journey, i basically found that it seems to be summed up perfectly in 2 chords. Cmaj, and like any combination of D,F,A, and G perhaps with G in the bass. in that 'secondary' chord, all in one moment, (which is the 'less' stable of the 2 chords when they are used in a musical context) that chord encapsulates the dual nature of the way these harmonies are working. is the F in that chord supposed to relate mainly to the C? or is it supposed to relate to the D in a pure minor third? and similarly, is the D supposed to relate to the G? the answer is, all 3 of these relationships are supposed to hold together. but this is mathematically impossible to happen exactly. so the entire essence of that Dmin, or 5dom7(sus if you like?) whatever, 'secondary' chord, the entire essence of that chord is that it contains different relationships that have to all sound like they work and yet they could never all 3 work exactly. the chord needs compromise in order to work. perhaps that is why it feels like the secondary chord or the 'less stable' or the 'i'm just waiting to go back to C' chord. realizing this changed me, because i was always told that equal tempered tuning was mainly used as a compromise to play in all 12 keys. but what i realized is you actually need it just to play in 1 key. like, just to play a 1 and a 2min. just to play the most basic essence of a key and have it work with itself. it really made me appreciate that 'secondary' chord (Dmin, G, etc) the D to F and the D to G relationship on kind of an earth shattering spiritual level, it's like the damn thing has heartbreak built right in. what you think you are hearing is the d to f relationship and the d to g relationship and the f to c relationthip, etc, all at the same time, when really it could never be, at least not exactly. but it is close enough to feel it. basically ever since this experiment i have had a wildly new appreciation for how and why music works, on an even more 'human' level than i expected. and i never questioned equal tempered tuning again"

It has no clear definition, and yet it still exists, people make it and people listen to it and buy it. There's lots of different ways people have defined music.. some have given really simplified answers. Edgard Varese has one of the most famous definitions of music as being  \"organized sound.\" Frank Zappa said \"a composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will on unsuspecting air molecules, often with the assistance of unsuspecting musicians.\" Barney Childs' definition is that \"A piece of music is simply a chunk of time you are paying attention to with your ears.\" Others have given definitions that are more abstract, like Beethoven (\"Music is the one incorporeal entrance into the higher world of knowledge which comprehends mankind but which mankind cannot comprehend\"). You said \"the only way i really know of to define it is by making some of it, or finding some of it to listen to. then you can go, \"ah, that's music. i think\"\" .... But if music is in the eye (or ear) of the beholder... where does that leave the composer/creator/performer? If someone makes something that they personally intended to be music, then shouldn't it music rather or not you or I (or any other listener) interprets it as such?",

            "when i listen to \"school\" i think it's a deep statement on human nature, and more specifically, ignorance in a depressing way. school is a metaphor for knowledge in general. the lines \"i don't wanna go to school, because i'm stupid, i don't want nobody tellin me what to do or how to get through this\" to me seem like a statement on how people prefer to figure out life on their own way. they think they can wing it, make it up as they go, improvise. the next lines \"i don't want nobody tellin me how to think, tellin me how to sing, tellin me how to do everything\" really emphasize this point. but in the next lines, the true intentions behind the narrator's willful ignorance is revealed. \"i don't wanna be afraid, of criminals, i don't wanna be afraid, of dangerous politicians\" is the climax of the story. he doesn't want to expose himself to the harsh realities of the \"real world\", which could also be why the song uses the metaphor \"school\", since students are ofte n warned about said \"real world\". \"i don't wanna be afraid of you, or of me, or the truth\" further this point, because scariness is everywhere, and we all wish it wasn't like that, but we know deep inside of us that it is. the last lines, \"said that girl made me feel blue, cause she told me I should stay in school, said that girl made me feel blue, don't go to school\" is a nice closer, in which the narrator turns his nose to people telling him to \"stay informed\" or even perhaps \"grow up\", because all it does is make people sad. do you think this analysis is appropriate? or am i overthinking just a really catchy, danceable song? love your videos, ants just crawled out of my laptop.",
