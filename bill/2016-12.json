            "i keep getting the feeling that you already know all this stuff, because you are doing everything perfectly, including things i haven't said yet (like the time signature). ok so take a look at the keyboard. play a C major scale (that's all the white keys from C up to C.) you will notice that all the notes are NOT actually the same distance apart, sound wise. to prove this, start on B and play all the white notes from B to B, it does NOT sound like a B major scale. to actually play every note you would include the black notes too. when you just play the white notes, you are getting a combination of larger and smaller intervals (called a 'whole step' or 'half step') depending on whether there is a black note in between. if you play all the notes going up, including white and black, you would get ALL half steps. i'm sure you already know all this. But let's look at the keyboard again, and look at the pattern of white/black keys, near the C note. you will notice that there is Another place on the keyboard where this pattern is almost the same, and that is near F. in other words, the black/white key configuration surrounding F is very similar to the black/white key configuration surrounding C. so start playing a scale starting from F, and play all the white notes from F to F. you may notice that this sounds Almost like an F major scale, but one note is wrong. the B. you can clearly see that that is where the black/white key pattern is not the same as it would have been for C. in C, going from the 3rd to 4th note there is no black note in between. but in F, there IS a black note there. in order to play a major scale right, that 3 to 4 interval needs to be a half step, just like it is in C. so when we play in F, you need to use the Bb note INSTEAD of B. play Bb, skip B. so play F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. and that should sound like the F major scale. as long as all the B's are always flat, you are safely in F major. when we write, this is where you use a 'key signature'. put a flat sign on the middle line. this goes right after the treble clef symbol, and before the time signature. this one flat will apply to every B in the tune, including the higher and lower ones! that's just the way it works. but don't put the key signature on the one you wrote in C! that would mess it up. start a new one, put the flat on the B line (again that is the F key signature), and write the melody again, starting on F! you almost don't even have to know the notes, just follow the same pattern through the scale. up 1, up 1, up 2, down 1, etc. when the melody moves up one, it goes from a line to a space (or space to a line). when it goes up 2, it goes from space to space, or line to line. these are the patterns you are looking for when you read and write, and as long as you get your key signature right, it should be pretty easy. let me know if you need me to name the notes, but i would guess that you have this whole thing figured out by now."

Start on middle C, which is that one off the bottom that needed a special piece of a line (that's called a ledger line by the way). there are no big jumps in this melody, so assume that each note is the one nearest to the previous (not an octave away). the highest note would be g, the lowest note is B, which is actually below the ledger line! so you have to make a ledger line just like you did for C, but put B below it. you don't need to make a ledger line for D. so this tune should have a total of 4 ledger lines. again, a ledger line is that little piece of a line that you made for C when it was off the edge of the staff. ok so that's the melody. try to sing or play it if you can. then we are going to move it into different keys and see which flats or sharps we need to use"

            "yes they are the same. there are various reasons you might choose one over the other. when we get into key signatures you should see this a little more clearly. if you have d, e, f#, g, a, you always want to use f# there instead of Gb because that way you have one letter for each note (one note on each line or space). if you used Gb in that situation, you would have no Fs and 2 Gs and you would have to keep flatting and unflatting the G. the 5 notes i just mentioned are actually part of a D major scale. so when you are in D major, for example, you can actually put the sharp symbol on the F line, at the beginning of the chart, (and also on C#, for the key of D) and then you can just use all the notes normally from D to D, and it automatically makes a D major scale because you already specified that the F and C notes are always sharp. (that is called a key signature). if you tried to use Gb and Db to make a D major scale, you would have to constantly be flatting and naturaling the D and G. it would be a freakin mess. but with a key signature, you just flip the F and C to sharps at the very beginning, and then all the notes in your staff automatically make D major. then if you want to flip to D min for a moment, you can use a natural sign on the F to make it temporarily natural. let me know if this makes sense and then i can try to show you the key signatures in a logical order"

            "ok, let's figure out how to make the other notes (the black keys). you will need flat and sharp symbols. let's use E. make an E note (it doesn't matter what rhythm it is). To make it an Eb (E flat) put the flat symbol immediately to the left of the note, aligned on the same line or space as the note. the flat symbol looks kind of like a lower case b, make sure the bump on the b is aligned the same way as the note. so if your note is on the bottom line (E) the flat symbol should be aligned to the bottom line, and just to the left of a note. if you make a line of E's, then make an Eb, you can keep making Eb's without putting any more flat signs. the flat symbol stays in effect for that note until the end of the bar. (some people say it's until the end of the line? not really sure actually. let's assume it is effective until the end of the bar.) Let's make a string of 8th notes (beamed in groups of 4), and put a flat symbol next to the 3rd note. now put a NATURAL symbol &#9838; next to the second to last note. the natural symbol is aligned according to the box in the middle. so put that box right on the same line (or space) as the note. the natural symbol is a way to undo the flat symbol. so if you have written this correctly, you should have 2 E notes, then 4 Eb notes, then the last 2 would be back to E (natural, which means not flat or sharp.) and you will have only used 1 flat sign and 1 natural sign. i hope this makes sense"

            "i am actually not so keen on that either. to do that, you basically need 3 elements- bass, chords, and melody. that's 3 things, and you only have 2 hands. there are different strategies -- one is to play the bass with your left hand, and chords with your right hand, and sing the melody. another strategy is to play in a band where there is a bass player, your left hand plays chords, your right hand plays the melody (that would be like in a jazz trio or whatever). or maybe there is a bass player and a singer also, in which case you have both hands free to do the chords. the piano is used in many different contexts, and in many different ways. if you are trying to do an entire piece of music by yourself, i think it is better to do the melody and chords in the same hand (right hand) and play the bass with your left hand. so basically just harmonize the melody, and keep the melody note on top of each chord. because if you have chords in your left hand then there's no bass? so that would be awkward. here's the issue i have with the whole situation-- i think in most music, the melody is actually in the same range as the chords. so if you are doing chords and melody at the same time on the same instrument, they are really going to occupy the same space on the keyboard. that is why i prefer to keep them both in the same range. there are so many different ways to make music, you have to just experiment and do what is right for the situation, depending on whether or not you are singing, and/or if you are playing with other players"

            "ok great. so your example shows 11 notes. they are all white keys on the keyboard. but the keyboard goes way higher and lower than that, all the notes could never fit into this one staff. so we need to specify what range we are in. actually there are only 2 commonly used range settings for the staff (the settings are called 'clefs') the most commonly used ones are treble and bass. let's look at treble for now. to specify that your staff is being used as a treble cleff, you need to put a treble clef symbol at the far left side of the staff, before the music starts. the treble clef symbol is crazy. good luck learning to draw it, but when you do learn it is fun. i usually start from the bottom, and draw a straight line up and then curve around and down. i think that is the easiest way to draw it. ok, so make a treble clef symbol on the left, and then make another staircase of notes, except this time start one lower than you started before (but what? there is no line there?) well make a tiny piece of a line, just big enough to house the note. then put the second note where your first note was in the previous example. make a total of 8 notes. your first and last note will be C. this is a C major scale. the lower C (the one you had to make a special line for) is called middle C. on a guitar, it is the first fret on the B string. on a bass guitar it is the 17th fret on the g string. on a piano it is somewhere in the middle of the piano. the frequency is about 262hz. let me know if you have got the scale written"

NOT beamed, but it will have a flag. if you just look up an image for an eight note you should see it. looks like a quarter note with a flag on top. so do 8th rest, 8th note. four times, and that should fill up the bar. so it sounds the same as a bar full of 8th notes, but every other one (alternating) will be missing. if you could link me to an imgur image or something i could easily confirm if you are doing it right. but otherwise i will have to just hope that you are doing it right. if you play this rhythm, with a metronome, the notes will be exactly in between the clicks. i hope that makes sense. please i would like to remind everyone that this is a multi part question that was started on 11.29.16 at 1:52pm, with the question \"how to learn to read music?\". If you are prompting me to go to the next step, and you are not the original person who posted that question at that time, you are being dishonest, and that is something you are going to have to live with"

(look up 'four 8th notes beamed' on google image search, you will probably find what this looks like. or just look up 8th notes beaming. When an 8th note is by itself it uses a flag, but when it is in a group like in our example, it uses beams.) So now you should have a bar full of 8th notes. 8th notes are worth half a beat, or 1 eighth of a bar. if you clap out this rhythm, the claps will be evenly spaced, and there will be 2 claps per beat. in other words you will be clapping twice as fast as the click. If your tempo (speed) is 70bpm, then you can actually get a sneak preview of what this will sound like, if you set your metronome to 140. the 140 click would be what 8th notes would sound like at 70bpm. now set the click back to 70 and try clapping out the 8th notes at 70. i hope this makes sense"

I will assume you know what all of those notes should look like. you pretty much mentioned all the important ones, except for sixteenth notes, which of course are twice as fast as eighth notes. there are some beaming rules for 8th notes and 16th notes, but first i want to make sure you know your 'rests.' a rest is a space where you don't play any note. it is a place holder, to let the time go by, and not play a note. there are all the same kinds of rests as there are notes (rhythm wise). quarter note rest (takes up one beat, or one quarter of the bar), eighth rest, 16th rest, half rest, whole rest. make sure you are familiar with all these. if you image-search any of those online you should see them instantly. So now in your second bar, put 2 quarter notes, then a quarter rest, then another quarter note. we are reading left to right here by the way. and the quarter notes and quarter rests should all be basically the same distance apart. now you can set your metronome (set it to about 70 bpm i guess) and then when you are ready to start, read what you wrote, by clapping. your instrument is a clap. clap when there is a note, don't clap when there is a rest. start whenever you are ready, but what it should sound like is you will be clapping on all the clicks for 6 clicks in a row, then a click with no clap, and then clap on the 8th click. that is what it would sound like if you clapped out what you have written. let me know if this makes sense. if you are confused i might be able to scrape together an image of what you should have written so far."
