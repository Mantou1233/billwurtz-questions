When i first wrote that, i was probably making an excuse for the song not being good enough. the original version of that was \"i don't have enough time to write the song i want to sing, so please don't judge me one little bit\". then, 2 years later, i re-wrote it with possibly slightly more experienced songwriting abilities",

            "for me this was just another extrapolation of my previous sentiment, because this part wasn't there in the original. it jumped straight to the 2+2 part after \"please don't judge me one little bit\"",

            "I wanna write a song\nOh, baby is that so wrong?\n\n---I believe this refers to how we wanted to do something, but people would often try to stop us, even if the thing we're doing isn't bad",

            "the 'too small' line is the worst line in the song. it is literally just a rhyme. horrible. i am against doing this. it breaks one of my best rules of songwriting, which is don't do that. The triple mall line(s), however, i stand behind. And it's basically my way of plowing fearlessly into the second verse. Think of it this way ........ i had just selected this song the day before, to be the next one that's recorded, and i was having major remorse about it (despite having been very diligent in the song selection). I really was feeling down about the whole thing, and i had already changed my mind about it and chose to do a much sadder and slower song instead. But then i was doubting that one just as much, so, i was actually at the barber and i was waiting for a hair cut, and i was trying to comprehend what went wrong in the song choice. So i came back to thinking about this 'la de da' song. At the time, the song was only written up until the end of the first chorus. so i guess i just briefly posed the question, 'what if i COULD do this one.... and what would the second verse most likely be, if i did it' and just as i was getting into the barber chair, the first 3 mall lines assaulted me right in the face. And i was immediately convinced that that seals the deal for the song choice, but that particular burst of writing went no further. and i was left to toil in the mud when i got home to try to complete the phrase. i made a bad decision, and i suppose i tried to mask it with background vocal arrangements",
            "I just went online\nTo explain the things I feel\nTo express the things I mean\n And it f elt so real\n\n---This refers to how we spent more time online than offline, and how our internet connection becomes more important",
            "i think, if you are talking about the last line, i think it is playing on the fact that the internet is real, while also using a phrase like \"it felt so real\" which is a phrase commonly associated with things that *might* not be real. so i was attempting to provide a little bit of intrigue there. Also one thing you forgot to mention was that i switched the words in the more common phrases 'explain the things i mean' and 'express the things i feel'. i switched the verbs, to see if it means something slightly different. turns out it does",

            "no, this is just meant to provide an alternate flavor of the line in the corresponding position in the verse before this. which you conveniently did not mention yet",
            "I know that you can relate\n\n---Yes",
            "it seems to be fairly common for people to make casual conversation about the world being all wrong",

            "you mentioned this out of order, but this comes after the \"just too small\" line. Perhaps the 'built some trains', 'traveling somewhere new' was my way getaway scheme, to escape from the blandness of the previous line. Or just assuming the mall was not a viable option. it is a natural progression to take a train somewhere else.... but with 10,000 bonus points for building your own train.\nWhen the subject of 'traveling somewhere new' comes up, it becomes impossible not to mention how wonderful the world is. when you think of all the possible places you could go. But then, when realizing that, the NEXT thing to immediately realize is it would be nice to have some companionship as well. OR, there is also a double meaning to 'still no you' line, it could also mean the world IS \"no you\". like, it's still doesn't compare to you. That's just in case maybe you took a look around at the world and still think it's not as good as it could be. so in that case you would be singing TO something which you think could be even better than the world. So in that moment, the line seems to mean those 2 things. But when the next line hits ('wonderful world for 2') i think it becomes more clear that it actually meant the first thing",

The la de da part sounds happy. Combine this with the meaningless of the lyrics, this means happiness without reason.",

If the condition changes (like we lose the next game, or someone accidentally hit our car when we're going home from work) we will no longer be happy\n---Gen uine happiness, on the other hand, doesn't have a reason. it's being happy simply because we existed. It's a feeling of being grateful because we're still here, regardless on the situation. This is what we all wanted.

Genuine happiness is as simple as being happy, but we struggle to find that, like how we don't understand simple words like \"la de da de yo\"",

And it's all done on the chart, on paper. Then around 2011 i got envious of more 'normal' songs, so i finally learned how to be organized enough to work on songs at an instrument, find a chorus first maybe, learn how to write what's before the chorus, you know, normal stuff. So i did a lot of that during 2011. Near the beginning of 2012, however, there was a day where i fondly remembered the joy of 'chain writing' so i did some of those. and 'the road' is one of them.

I want to have a goal of 1 new musical idea per *reasonable amount of time*, but I don't know how to prioritize between investing time into new things when I have ideas outstanding that need attention. Do you have any suggestions/have you experienced this? thanks",
            "basically what i did, when i was first in your situation, is to just keep coming up with new ideas. let them pile up. This is probably because i may have had a fear of not having enough ideas. Then it rapidly became a problem. Another thing i began doing is writing songs entirely on paper, and i would demand to finish the whole thing in 1 session. That's one way of dealing with it. so i wrote more and more and more. Sometimes they wouldn't get finished, sometimes they would. Usually if it was shorter, it would get finished. but they all got put into the list regardless. more years went by with more writing like this. It was more rare that i would ever record any of them. Eventually when the problem became even more serious, i finally found a way to work on the existing ideas. This is a whole separate task from generating new ideas, and i still consider them separate. For a couple years i ONLY did 'middle writing', which is where i work on existing ideas. Then a few months later, as i was getting ready to start recording some of them, i did a few weeks of finishing, just finishing writing for songs. I could talk for years about the different systems i've used for SELECTING which ones to work on. And this is not even to discuss selections for the recording process, which you didn't ask about. Eventually as enough years go by, you start to feel your life running out, so you probably take drastic measures. Nowadays, for me this is how it works: new ideas can come any time, that's always true. Sometimes they even come in dreams. So i catch them whenever they arrive, and i don't really do a writing session at that time because it's usually not the right time. but you just try to catch as much as you can. That's totally separate from any writing process or work process. Separately from that, it is a linear process of working toward the item i am releasing next, and i work on that 1 item until it's done. For songs, first what i do, at the beginning of a project, i do a round of new song idea generation, but this is NOT necessarily promising that any of these will be the one that's used. This is just to ensure that i am giving myself a chance to generate new ideas, which might have a chance of getting picked. So i generate some new ideas, maybe 10 or 15. Sometimes i use various different methods, just to make sure i've given myself a chance to try various things. Then, when that's done, i do song 'selection', which is where i'm going to choose which one is going to be recorded, for the next release. This selection is made from the ENTIRE list, which includes the new ones but also includes all the other ones, which are all at various levels of completion (writing). Once a selection is made, then it's quite simple. I finish the writing all the way, first, then record it, all the way. then make the video, all the way. I should clarify that this procedure didn't become solidified until after many many many years of ambiguity which may be similar to what you are going through now"
