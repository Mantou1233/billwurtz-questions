'i wonder if you remember' ... 'i remember the morning ...' 'do you remember the morning you said that it's over' ... i'm just reading what i wrote down in that writing session. these were all brainstormed lines for the first verse before i found the real thing. 'i wonder if you remember the place that we came from' . none of these are good enough .... ' i remember the first time i said something intelligent' ... 'i remember the moment i left where i came from ' ... 'i remember the first thing i said when i got here' ... There are some slightly more interesting ones but i can't tell you them. 'i'm slipping under the blanket where nobody sees me' i don't know if that was supposed to be for the first line or for another line but it fits the same melody. i can see the post card lyric floating around here. actually took quite a bit of brainstorming before the actual first line came to me (moment that my dreams were broken) and i very distinctively knew that had to be it. and then from there it's just coming up with lines are good enough. keep coming up with lines until one of them seems good enough. then keep going. etc. that's about all there is to it. and if you don't have a deadline you will never think anything is good enough, and if you have a deadline you still won't think it's good enough but that will force you to come up with something that is almost good enough maybe"

I think that throughout my career as a musician I have contracted a virus that I can only identify as \"bridge section fanatic syndrome\" or something. It happens even with the classics, to me. Name an artist, I will likely be a fan of their bridges or \"c sections\" alone, even with their most classic songs. It happens with music from all eras (although lately I'm finding a lack in true bridge sections as an entity, if you will, specially in hip hop and trap, even though I enjoy a lot of the music). Those sections are NOTHING without the context of the song but somehow I find myself listening to the entire thing just to get there and enjoy them, justified in my enjoyment for having given that section it's moment to shine (not isolated) but preferring it to the rest of the track nonetheless. It's really weird and it just hit me, thinking about it. I find myself writing songs and instrumentals as strong as I  can with  the purpose of having the thrill of creating a bridge that I love, just for that piece of music.
