(i.e. 'lemon song' probably should have a lemon in the video). But here's a new twist that i've found: if you try to come up with visuals at the same time as writing the song, it actually helps you write the song. Even if that visual is not even used.... even if you dont even come up with any specific visual ...... just telling yourself to activate the part of your brain that thinks of visuals, for some reason it makes the songwriting 10x more potent. even if no visual is thought of, it tricks your brain into going to the right place. just to pretend you are supposed to be coming up with the visual. so in other words, when you're writing a song, pretend you're writing a video. it doesn't even matter if you even make a video, just tell your brain you're writing a video, and often you won't even come up with any visual but it still jumpstarts the songwriting when you think that way. hopefully i've explained it. i started doing that with 'best friends with my own front door', and i've been using that trick ever since. it's like opening the door to the next room, to help give you perspective on the room you are in"

There are some problems with this system-- one problem is that in some countries the notes are not named like this (quarter, eigth, etc). And the other problem is that when the top number is a multiple of 3 and the bottom note is 8, it's usually not actually the 8th note that gets one beat, it's usually actually 3 eighth notes that get one beat. but at least the bar length will adhere correctly to the number system, so for example what i'm trying to say is, 6/8 in the real world usually does not actually mean 6 beats per bar with the 8th note getting one beat. instead it usually actually means there's 2 beats per bar and the dotted quarter note gets one beat. this is mathematically equivalent, but felt differently, for speed. but let's face it, who really wants to write 2/2.667"

I've been listening to a few pieces in different temperaments but 19-TET seems to resonate particularly well for me for some reason, even though I don't fully get it.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how to use it myself but without a custom built 19-TET keyboard, it would be very difficult. Maybe I can manually write notes in a MIDI roll, but I want to be able to improvise. Even with one though, how do scales work? It seems to be still 8 notes, which I suppose maybe makes sense but then again does it and what do you do with all the other notes?!? Why do we use 8? Why do we use 12?\n\nI was looking into this and then I found Just Intonation (JI) again - yes I suppose it makes sense why we use 12-TET but why can't we use JI with modern tech? Can't we just change the fundamental when we modulate? Or, is it deeper than that? With JI (in C) does it mean that if I play an Fm7, it wil l still  sound wrong as a C#7 would? I can't figure out how to properly play with a Just keyboard without spending $1400 on digital piano that does it for me.\n\nI think if our mortal minds could fully grasp this, then we would be able to create even more wonderful music. I think it's transcendental and we will never fully understand. Do you think? Or have I just not studied hard enough?\n\nAhh I've been looking at this for days and I feel like it's at the very fundamental of music in general.

However, (and this was unclear to me from your description) if the old 16th note needs to become the new 8th note (in 12/8) then you can write sixteenth note equals eighth note.

            "I think i read that it was made a little after history of the entire world, but it kinda has the early bill wurtz vibe",
            "here are my thoughts about it. it is an interesting case study in deadlines vs non deadlines, it's also an interesting case study in brute force randomized song selection, and it's also a good case study in making arrangement adjustments at the very last moment.\ndeadlines vs non deadlines:\ni knew the entire time when i was making history of the world that i wanted to do songs constantly, forever, and i wanted to do this before history of the world, but history of the world became unexpectedly more important. so the entire time i had the idea that i was going to do songs next. so finally when i was done, i immediately jumped into the song. i had a general idea that i was going to use a weekly deadline, but i wasn't ready to do it quite yet. i wanted to take my time and do it 'right'. i got some good things, the initial groove/vamp sound was found then, and some other things, but after several days, maybe even a week, i felt everything slowing down, and i couldn't seem to make good decisions anymore. so i suddenly set a deadline and then demanded to do them weekly after that. Immediately after setting that deadline, i suddenly made a bunch of bold instrumental choices that wouldn't have been made otherwise. some of the percussion fills in the first verse, a lone loud bongo bonk, a hyper spaz hi-hat fill followed by a huge crash, if i remember correctly those are examples of decisions i made immediately after declaring being on a deadline.\nbrute force randomized selection:\nusually if i try to select the next song without randomized assistance (like, actually choose which one i want to do) it's usually a downward spiral into rejecting everything. every song is too this or too that. too weak, too intense, too emotional, to dumb, too smart, too slow, too fast, too weird, too normal, etc etc. And i have no courage to take any risks. So the alternative to this is just getting a brute force random number. count all the songs in the list, (at this time it was something like 400), and get a computer generated random number from that range, and you MUST do that song. Well, i was willing to accept the result, but the problem here with the result (california) is that the song features a massive marijuana reference. This would be ok except for the fact that i had already had multiple marijuana references in songs before that. Ultimately i went forward with the selection because i felt like i had no other choice, but this highlights a problem with brute force random selection. Yes, it helps you avoid thinking EVERY song is 'wrong', but there's a weird fine line to reckon with because some songs ACTUALLY are 'wrong', considering the previous songs. For example, this song being about california, the following song (also chosen with brute force random) was called \"i love you\". Well, there is also a song in the list called \"California Love\" which has nothing to do with those other two. So, imagine for a moment, if \"California Love\" was picked next, after those other two. that would be terrible, it would look like an obvious deliberate themed connection, which it is not. fortunately the randomizer did not pick that, and the next 2 choices turned out ok. and since then i have developed a hybrid system that allows me to mostly rule out any of these problems before the randomized selection is made\nmaking arrangement changes at the last moment:\nusually, after the instrumental arrangement is done, and the vocals are done, and mixing is done, and i'm in the final troubleshooting stage, there can be an extreme resistence against going back and changing things in the arrangement. you just don't want to re-open what seems like a sealed box. but occasionally it has to be done, and i've learned that i MUST let myself be open to that. this song is a good example: those synth riffs in the background of the \"it's alright\" parts. Those were added at the very end. like during the final adjustments / mixing / troubleshooting phase. i opened the arrangement again to add those riffs there. and it made a huge difference\nsome additional thoughts about the writing:\nit's important to point out that this song was essentially written in august 2011 (about 6 years before it was recorded). So this may slightly change the way the lyrics are perceived. Marijuana was not fully legal in any state at that time. and the reason it is about California is because that is the state that was most well known for marijuana usage at the time, because i think it had recently become legal medically. For every other state mentioned in the song, i'm pretty sure, it was still very illegal, especially in Alabama which i believe had some of the toughest marijuana laws at the time. One of the reasons i featured it in the second verse. Also, the final line of the song (love who you want to) was certainly a reference to the legalization of gay marriage, which at the time was only legal in certain places, which is another thing California was known for at the time"
