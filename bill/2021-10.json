The problem is every time I think about doing the recording I just really don't want to. Just setting up all the equipment and then plugging everything in and doing the whole thing just sounds like so much effort. I've used the stuff a lot before, so it's not l am scared it will be confusing or anything, it's just that recording always sounds like so much work. Do you ever get like this? Am I just a lazy musician? How do I force myself to get it all done?",
