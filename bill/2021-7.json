At work in the amazon warehouse many ideas came to me. and I would run around like a crazy person trying to find a pen and paper to write them down. then at home after a while I ended up having a stack of these ideas. then two stacks and three. then I went for yoga teacher training and learned about aparigraha and wanted to become detached and the feeling I get when an idea comes feels very attached so I wanted to get rid of my stacks of ideas. so I got rid of most of them and kept a few. But now I'm thinking, why do I need to capture every idea? because I'm not the source of them. The source is endless! and if the source wanted me to have an idea at a certain point in time, it would send one, right? so maybe that's how I can remain detached while also being open to receiving ideas. But then again I have nothing to show for any of this yet, while you have much to show for your methods of capturi ng all possible ideas. So maybe I shouldn't have gotten rid of my stacks of ideas. Oh well. The past is the past.",

Ideas seem to come more readily when you are not expecting. that's why i think it's important to write these down, because this might be your main best source of ideas. Then, the songwriting department just has to learn how to work with ideas that are handed to them, from the list. then there's whole other department called the selecting department, but that's another story entirely"

            "yes. What i would have preferred to do, is to be able to actually create that entire alphabetical phrase list. which i was able to generate quite easily, but the problem we run into, when the list goes into the graphics, .... the list is so long that it actually makes the computer lag, or probably even crash, depending on how you do it. There's literally millions of lines in that text pattern, if it were carried out properly from a to z across all 6 characters. So even though it's just text, it actually is an absurdly unnecessary strain on the memory of the scene, pretty much any way you slice it. And the truth is, in that scene, with the small amount of time it's shown, you'd never see all the lines. and also, another reason you don't wanna include the whole list is that the scroll direction would become incoherently out of phase. like those car wheels on tv that seem to move slow or backwards or whatever. So it turns out, even just to create the proper looking downward scroll, you need to reduce the number of elements drastically. like pretty much skip 99% of the parts during the fast scroll. But this still does create a continuity problem, because if anyone sees the (maybe 1) frame where you can see it jump from A to L or whatever, .... i feel there's gonna need to be an explanation there. So my explanation is 'memory' as a place holder for the perhaps millions of lines we've skipped"

            "Hi Bill, I recently wrote a full song (Chords, melody, lyrics, tempo, form) and I've started recording it. The problem is I'm really struggling with fleshing out the arrangement. So far I've recorded temp piano, guitar, and vocals.I feel like the song doesn't have any peaks and valleys, the verse chorus and bridge all feel at the same energy level. Maybe this is a writing or performance issue? I don't know what order to work on stuff e.g. should I have started with drums? I also don't know what sounds to use to fill out the arrangement? I'm just sitting in front of my computer scrambling to get anything that works, I spent all day yesterday working on it and all I achieved was one tiny counter melody part on vibraphone. I also don't know where these other parts should land and how to not make it sound too busy and cluttered. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I love the arrangements on your songs because they are so detailed and intricate and I love th e variety of tones and timbres you use. Thanks!",
            "i think i have the ultimate solution for this, because i think i've been through this exact same scenario before. and i can safely say that the only way i know how to solve this is to start with much much much shorter songs. Ultimately i feel like i didn't start making good progress on this until i actually started writing songs that were as short as 1 second. Then i started to watch all the necessary concepts and procedures take shape easily. and then you can gradually work your way up to longer songs after that. Starting with something full length is gonna be way too many huge unknown variables at the same time"

And i also was limited to songs that had more content written, rather than picking a tiny fragment. so the options for a selection were limited.
