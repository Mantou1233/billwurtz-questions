Now, here's another thing, do you ever feel like something you're trying to do gets \"lost in translation/adaption\"? Example: I have this amazing short story. One of the best things I've written thus far. There's this playwright competition thing I'm doing for school (two actually). I had this great idea: \"Hey, I'm going to turn that short story of mine into a stage play\" So, I start writing. And ew. In my head the idea worked so well, but on paper it's just not good. It loses all the stuff that made the original so fucking good. It made me kinda resent the story and avoid working on the script but the deadline is rearing it's godawful head and I'm going to have to finish it even though i don't like it and it just isn't what I wish it was. Oh, another thing I hate ab out it.  I'm expected to write a good play but they (the judges i guess) put so many restrictions on it.",

However as someone who just wants to know whats going on inside that brilliant brain of yours, it drives me absolutely insane! You so very clearly have ideas you want to  convey a nd messages you want to communicate with everyone, and about 80% of these questions have genuine answers about motivation, attitude and inspiration, all of which are actually GREAT advice!

'power chords' seem most at home in a reasonably low range, around the low area of a guitar. not to be confused with 'power cord' which provides electricity for the chord"

            "one weird weird thing i noticed, i was mixing hallelujah for way way too long and feeling trapped and down about it, listening to 'new rules' side-by-side with it and just wanting to die over it, (by the way this was just days before i found out the loudness war is officially over. so now we don't have to worry about that which is huge huge news, but this was right before i realized that) anyway, i had done all this work on the mix for hallelujah, and it's also just a really dense and layered textural arrangement, etc, and whatever, and then i was poking around for reference songs (such as new rules and several other songs done by other people) and was generally freaking out about how much clearer everyone else's songs sounded but (i'm getting to the point of this, hold on) here's the surprise: i accidentally opened up one of my jazz jam sessions (like anything you would hear on the 'jazz' section of this site) and i was shocked to find out that that recording sounded so much more clear, sounded like it was mixed much much better, but as we all know it is not even mixed at all. those are instrumental jams where i lay down each instrument in 1 crazy take, bounce it out and call it a day. and the point is, i found out that that mix (which was no mix) had a lot more punch and clarity than this hallelujah mix which i had so tenderly spent so many long days on. the lesson was , ...... if you use a million instruments it is a real challenge to mix it out of sounding like mud. even if it's very tenderly layered and arranged instruments, the point is, if there are many instruments, they will clog up the mid range, like that troublesome 100-300 range. but if you use only 3 or 4 instruments,  ..... it's just got automatic clarity. so that's something. so this works to my advantage now working under these crazy deadline schedules, because i simply don't have time to make as dense an arrangement, and it is therefore easier to mix. Another thing i learned, on the subject of working faster, is, ... work faster. you gravitate toward what matters. and it is so easy to lose your mind if you listen to that damn thing for too long. you'll just lose your mind ...... another way to get tips is watching a billion mixing tutorials and tips videos until you realize they are all starting to contradict each other, and then you forget it and do what you want"
