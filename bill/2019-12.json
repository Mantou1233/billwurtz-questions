            "first of all i think you might be better off digitally, with computer files. because they are easier to store and manage without making a mess. ok, so, keep updating your 'random' category. this will be your good friend, as you get new ideas. that is fine. there is another job title which is going through the 'random' category, selecting one, and figuring out how to turn it into a more tangible project idea, like the others. What i would suggest to you is this: use a random number generator to choose a number based on how many projects there are, plus 1 for the random ideas category (so currently this number would be 7). i can recommend (ref: https://random.org)random dot org for that. set the range from 1 to 7. (also you must assign numbers to the categories, so you know what the numbers mean). if it lands on the random category (7), then tangify 3 random ideas into actual project ideas, and use random dot org to select which ones from that category to do. then go back and do another random selection again (with a higher number this time, because hopefully you will have added more projects). Here's what i recommend: you must finish the project that is selected. If this seems too overwhelming, then I would recommend doing shorter projects until you are more confident in the procedure. some people are ok with bouncing between projects, but every time i've tried this, it simply turns into a license to escape. so these are my best recommendations"

            "that's already mostly solved. the best way i was able to wrap my head around it is to always export the image sequence to the temp folder. let it overwrite, and as part of the video exporting procedure, i convert the image sequence into a video file, which automatically names itself based on the date and time. an extra challenge is that my preferred software for that sort of thing was quicktime 7 which is also gone. so i am using ffmpeg instead, and i have automated the whole procedure to a single button press using keyboard maestro, which is also what generates the dated file names. i still have no idea how anyone else manages files/exports from blender, but that is the way i am currently doing it. it's worth mentioning that the other tremendous hangup i had with blender in 2016 was the lack of save prompts, and the constant risk of so easily losing the project. but i was thrilled to see that save prompts are there now. and i also used keyboard maestro to get even more robust autosaves"

To explain that in a more real life setting, if you made a system of only 6 letters, with sharps placed between all of them, you would find that playing on only the plain letter keys would produce a very dizzy disoriented sound, akin to a time-warp or flashback scene. but instead the way the letters are actually arranged, this way you can just play the plain letter keys and automatically get something very friendly sounding, like joy to the world, right out of the box"

I was absolutely crapping myself with anxiety coz when I was a kid I witnessed a fatal plane accident and I'd never been over water in a plane and was overthinking like crazy. Anyway. I opened up YouTube for the first time in ages to try to find something to distract myself and at the top was Airport Terminal. I thought \"oh wow that's a cool coincidence\" and I watched it and it calmed me right down because it made the whole experience seem like a cool adventure. Thanks very much for unknowingly helping me. Also, the editing in that video is fucking stupendous and it blows my mind to think of the amount of work you put into it.",

Look at even the most well respected pieces of art. You can see how they're crap if you put yourself in the artist's shoes. (is anyone going to think this is good, or is it just crap). So go ahead and adopt that mindset early, and that should allow you to have a nice rebellious good time, in the meantime, while you are gradually and unassumingly accumulating genuine experience, which will inevitably happen over time"

FINALLY A QUESTION FOR YOU do you think if you engaged in this sort of improvise-stack-more-no-precomposing-allowed that you'd let yourself get more weird and less polished or would you allow so much re-improvising that it eventually just became a kind of postcomposition? i am having some trouble with the bits of the improvs i don't think are as successful;should i allow chop-ups or is the one-initial-take rule a good one? i thought i could get this done faster if i hobbled my perfectionism by specifying ONLY spontaneous improv allowed, but there are so many ways to elude the spirit of that law and no external deadline requiring i actually do it any faster. what u think",

The rest of the class was enjoyable and the exams were easy, but I didn't really take anything away from it besides the stress.I love history, but what I really want to do is to is to write… fiction… movies. I do want to write about history, mostly about the history of American folk music, but I don't know if I want history to be more of a hobby than a career.

For example, if i released a reality video using journal audio recorded today, you might (for example) hear me talking about how i am definitely building an animatronic giraffe, and i am very excited about it. Well, guess what, if i release something like that, 2 things might happen. 1 is, i might ultimately fail at building the giraffe and have to abandon the project, in which case it would look very embarassing for me, because everyone would know i failed. And also it might be possible that someone could steal my design for animatronic giraffe and rush to beat me at my own idea. That's a fictional example, but here's an actual example, of a reality video that was released relatively soon after it was recorded -- probably recorded soon after history of japan was released, and the reality video was released probably 3 months later. The subject of the video was about making a music album. I thought, at the time, that i was going to make a music album, of songs. I thought that was a good idea at the time. but since then, i have changed my opinion and now i strongly prefer single songs. So those reality videos talking about making an album look pretty silly now, and they also incite a lot of people to ask \"where's the album, what happened to the album\", but there is no album. If i had waited a bit longer before releasing journals from that time, i surely would not have chosen the album discussions, and would have gone with something else instead"

            "not really a transition.... i've tried both, and when i don't write it first, it just doesn't have the freedom to go where it wants to go. As i'm saying this now, i can see that it appears backwards, but the reason is because when you're recording a song there are lot of instruments and parts to deal with, so you can't very easily change the way the song goes, on a whim. I've found that it's a much greater advantage when you write the song before anything is recorded, because you can make the song go anywhere, on a whim. you just write it there and it goes there. in other words, writing is not like writing multiple instruments. i don't write the instruments, i write the *song*. which consists of melody+lyric+chords, all the way through, and knowing the exact tempo. The process of translating that into instruments only happens once the song is written. it's probably a lot like animating a cartoon. it's pretty hard to improvise a cartoon. you kind of have to know how it goes before you do it. you CAN however, improvise a cartoon by acting it out, improvised. then based on the recorded improv, make the cartoon. similarly, a song could be made by improvising it using 1 instrument and voice, and then constructing the arrangement based on that recording. i forgot the question"

To make any sense of the world at all, we must describe things in ways that we can comprehend, rather than actually listing the location and status of every molecule at every point in time. Because of this, every person may seem to see the world differently ..... not because they actually see or hear any differently, but because when faced with infinite data points, there are infinite different ways to make sense of them, or choose which ones to even look at, and when"
