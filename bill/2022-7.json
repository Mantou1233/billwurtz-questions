I then i narrowed it down to a list of 16, including \"i'm scared\", \"huge gamer\", the figure that would become \"corner store\", and the vamp that would become \"i'm happy\". Then i asked the computer to choose for me from amongst those 16, and it chose number 10 which was \"i'm scared\". Then i think the first thing i did was i changed it so the bass gets around the line in 1 bar instead of 2, because it seemed to slam harder that way. then i wrote the rest of the song according to my best songwriting procedures and practices"

            "\"tri-tone substitution\" would be like let's say if you have a normal song in the key of C, and you have that D7 chord, which famously contains the notes F# and C in the chord. If you lie around thinking about music for long enough you'll notice that you can play the F# and C notes in the chord, with the D bass note, and that gives you the D7 chord, but you can also put the bass on Ab instead and that gives you an Ab7 chord just the same. So a \"tri-tone substitution\" is when you use Ab7 instead of D7. (or A7 instead of Eb7. or Bb7 instead of E7. and so on). seems crazy but it just might work"
