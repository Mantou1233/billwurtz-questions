I've listened to the Beatles, Queen, Elton John, etc, the legends, y'know? And while their stuff is good, it's not \"incredible\", like my first artist. Do I have expectations that are too high to compete with, or am I just lucky to have one artist I love so much, and give up on that ever happening again?

(this is supposed to be a joke that has been written after the whole text is finished since i feel guilty about asking a SERIOUS!!!!question that is 2362 sentences long.) \n\ni may write the lyrics down depending on my knowledge of their music and that's all. and i dont give a damn about not being able to do this since i am not going to \"show\" my music instead of playing it somehow anyways. so the closest thing to keeping them down that i have, is recording that sessions with my cellphone, which now has 4236426427624 unnamed voice recordings which seems impossible to quarry now........\n\nanyways, now that i have many songs that feel complete by-heart, i want to have some better demos. not \"sonudingbetter\" demos but demos that show more about the work. which needs a daw for more layers, which i have. \n\nthe problem i s, whenever i open it and have my connections ready, my hand just does not go to my songs to play. its some kind of fear that is not actually fear? maybe a fear of redundance i dont know. i just want to add the layers that are in my head but never heard since i am only one person and have only recorded them live. how can i get over this things? whenever i open the daw i just play a song from my streaming services and play things over them, find some silly guitar effects and experiment on them, but my hands never want to press the record button and play the whole progression just once and then play some other things on them which is the only thing i need. whenever i start thinking about that, my mind goes crazy about what-ifs, and i see myself getting lost in the muddiness of my ears understanding why the recordings suck but my hands have no idea how to try and fix it with my unwhole knowledge about the frequencies... i dont even want them to be ready-to-go songs right now, thats one  of the next couple of steps. i just want them to represent what i have in my heart and head in a better manner. i have been trying to start this for a long time... \n\nhow can i start doing this? should i learn to how to write music down someway? will it be a good tool to have in my pocket, depending on my problems? it just seems like i just got to start somehow, but i just cant... you seem like a person who can understand me about this, any and every kind of insight from you is appreciated. \n\ni love every single thing you had ever done. at least the things that were somehow presented to me, and a great source of inspiration. \n\nplease help................",

By placing this in 1900, it's giving you an alternate view of the same story from an earlier point in time, and it also gives you the listener the sensation of actually being in the future, as you are listening to it more than 100 years later. so it hopefully rings especially true that times did change and indeed still are"
