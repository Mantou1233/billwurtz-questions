I, on the other hand, think art is not simply about knowledge and technique as it very much is about expression as well, and each artist is free to decide which tools they are going to use to express themselves and how. there's no need for \"levels\", \"better and worse\": there's no need to rank artists according to their ability, what' s the po int in having a \"caste system\" in art? who benefits from that? if he thinks knowing all that he can know about music theory is what works for him, that's great!, for him. but it doesn't mean everyone should follow the same path, otherwise they aren't \"actual musicians\". what gets me the most is he teaches childre music, and it hurts me to think how he might be one of those teachers I so deeply disliked when I was a kid: people who think they hold the Entire and Absolute Artistic Truth in their hands because they're adults and teachers and they studied some, and therefore they have the right and duty to trim kids' (and people in general's) thoughts. \nI know you are a person and your opinion is also subjective. I also know, from following you and your work, that you don't appear to be close-minded at all. maybe that's why I'm here: reassurance. I firmly believe in what I said about art: I think about it a lot and I change my mind, I try to be as open as I can to new ideas , but th ere's also a core value of art not needing to be constrained, and the importance of artistic freedom, that I keep throughout my life. but am I the unreasonable one in this situation? we are often blind to our own flaws, most of all when they touch us deeply. is that the case here?\n\nsorry for the wall of text.",

That doesn't mean you can't, but what i have found is that most of the time, if i try to write a song in the 'recording studio', the result is exactly what you just described. this is exactly why, after experimenting a little with the 'write in studio' approach somewhere around 2011, i came to a firm realization that i MUST write and finish the song BEFORE bringing it to the official recording environment. so so important. Recording a song, has enough unknowns and challenges. not even knowing how it goes is WAY too many unknowns. my policy is, i must know how it goes, i need to know every word, every melody, chords, and what's also particularly important to me is that i have the exact 'road map', which means know exactly how long everything goes -- no uncertainty about the ending, no uncertainty about transitions, intros, etc etc, no uncertainty about how it gets from point a to point b. the whole roadmap must be known from beginning to end. not necessary to have every little auxiliary detail, not even necessary to know all the exact instrumental parts. but, you just need the exact melody, lyric, chord, full road map. and also important to have an exact tempo marking, to avoid what i call a 'tempo crisis.' This is just what i've found. not knowing this will cause things to crumble in the studio, at least that is definitely the case when working by yourself. This is not necessarily true for everyone, and i'm sure this approach is more applicaple to people doing the entire arrangement on their own (like me, and perhaps you too). and i'm aware that many many many people write songs in the studio, and i'm sure some people can do it just fine, but i have become quite sure that, for me, without a shadow of a doubt, the 'write first' approach is a must for me, and after reading your story i would strongly advise this for you also. i hope this helps"

            "A comment on \"Hi, I'm Steve\" said that the video was depicting the life of a depressed schizophrenic who the video shows gradually mentally destabilizing because he is not happy in life. The comment then goes on to state that the video is told through Steve's eyes and the \"random bursts into jingles\" show how \"childlike his mind is\". The mountains are categorized as his mental issues, which he can't climb, but due to the mail (medication) that the girl mailman (doctor/nurse) delivers to him helps to mask these issues to help it look like they are working. According to the comment, he then states that he can suddenly climb the mountains, proving that the medication is appearing to work. The rain at the end implies depression which is the result of the medication not helping Steve. The weather forecast at the very end depicts that he will have this depression forever, and the final line, \"Bye, I'm Steve\" shows that he is not happy with life and kills  himself.  I'd like to know your thoughts on this theory. All credits for the comment go to shredup chopel.",

To find out, go to preferences, go to 'keymap', and in the search bar type 'search' and you should see something called 'window search', and it should say what key it is, which for me is saying F3 but i can't remember if that's the default setting. Another thing you might find useful, for example, in the node editor windows, whenever you press 'shift A' to add something, that menu has a search thing in it, so in that case it would be 'shift A', 'S' to trigger that, if you happen to be in a node editor window which will allow you to search nodes to add. some of the other sections probably have search tricks hiding in them as well, but as i said the main one is called 'window search' and it's F3 on mine which may or may not be the default but you can find out in the preferences and set it to your own choice"

I am specifically talking about wired mode (forget bluetooth). The only reliable way to make the thing work is to log out and log in again, you have to do this each time you want to start drawing on a new day basically. i am pretty disappointed because it is supposed to be a high quality tablet which is pretty expensive. The only other wacom experience i had was with the 2012 wacom bamboo which i was using on mac os 10.6.8, for years and years, and worked perfectly, always, any time i needed it. Besides this, another side note which i have learned about a graphics tablet is i think i have concluded that a small tablet is actually better. unless it has an actual display on it in which case larger would be better but that's almost a different product entirely, and a very different price range, more comparable to an ipad or touch laptop"

Heres a secret tho, Im terrified of actually finishing the song in case it doesnt come out as the masterpiece i imagine with this work in progress. Do i really want anything if i dont do anything?",
            "yes. the trick is, there is a tangle in the logistics of the exact steps and methods of HOW, on a very simplistic level. there are some very important unknowns here that you are unable to find the answers for, because you have not clearly located the questions. but they are there. untangling these small issues will cause magnificent surges of fresh unique inspiration that are so distinctively you that you will not be able to resist the seemingly automatic forward motion that will occur as a result. it will be as easy and addictive as chips, but lightyears more powerful. i am narrowing it down to 2 issues here: 1 is the tangled confusion of issues you know somewhere deep within your mind need to be answered, but are buried too deep to remember the details, and the other issue is simply the fear that this song will be your only song. which, to be fair, it may seem that way based on your observation of the current pace. the important rule here is that every song gets better, but i realize this doesn't help if the pace does not seem commensurate with any realistic progress timeframe. So, you need to approach this tangle. It's important to recognize that recording and arranging your own songs is by nature a very tangly and complicated mess. for this reason, it is vitally important that you practice simplicity at all costs, in every aspect of the arrangement. always remember, there was once a time when people had to record on 4 track tape machines and the only way to get more tracks was to burn 3 tracks down to 1, never being able to change them again. in some ways i'm sure your computer software is crippling because it affords you too many options. so simplicity is necessary at all costs, and i think you can expect to have to remind yourself that again and again. But as far as untangling the confusion points, i will tell you one thing that is vitally important to me which i cannot live without, and i've done it for years and continue to do it to this day, in fact it saved my day today and rescued me from the sour depths similar to what you described, and continues to save my ass again and again for at least 10 years or more now, and it's this: keeping a very open freeflowing documentation/discussion of your entire thought process and everything relating to the project, and stay especially in touch with the origins of the project and continue to backtrack and re-explain to yourself how and why you started doing this project and everything that led to it and everything that has gone into it. keep a constant open dialogue with yourself, whether in writing, text, audio, video, or all of those at the same time. drench yourself in discussion of the issues. get it all out in the open. it's like a tangled rope. what you have been doing, it seems, as you described it in your question, is trying to pull on the ends of the rope. what i am describing is when you go into a large room, and lay the rope out on the floor and get a better look at how this thing got this way. and the crazy thing is, every time, when you start to solve it and those tangles come out, not only is it wildly refreshing to have a freely untangled rope, what's crazy is all these memories start flooding back to you about every little tangle as it comes out, and suddenly start to remember exactly how all of them got there in the first place. it's like the big bang all over again"

            "i'm stopping if i have to check past 127. that's my new rule. 46692, even, so halve it, 23346, and again, a little more difficult, my trick is digit by digit but for odd digits go one lower and then add 5s back, one digit to the right of where the odd digits were. so 11123, then put the 5s back as 11673. checking for 3, it's just adding up the digits, and you can knock them out as you see them. 1167 digits add up to 15, so yes, we have 3 in it. must divide 11673 by 3. knock off the 3, is 1167, add 3 is 117(0), 117 is 9 times 13 or 39 times 3. so retrace the steps, 39 times 3 is 117, need to go down to 1167 (from 1170) which means 390 minus 1, is 389, then the other way to add 3 (for 11673) means add 1 to 389 in the next digit, so 3891. so 3x3891 should be 11673, does that look right. yes. Check for 3 again, in 3891, it's there again, because knock the 9 and knock the 8 and 1, and 3 left. how about 3000 and 810 and 81. so 1000 plus 270 plus 27. 1270 plus 27. 1297. so 1297x3=3891, does that look right. yes it does. Ok so check for 7, knock it off the right leaves 129, known to be 43, so 7 is out. checking 11 (in 1297), knock it off the left, 197, already no because it would need to be 198, so no 11. checking 13, well 3 more is 1300 so no. checking 17 (in 1297), take it off the right, it's 128, that's a power of 2 so no way. checking 19, 1297 minus 57 is 124, in half is 62, then 31, so no. Being aware of the limits here, we only have to check up to the square root of the target number, so right now that means the square root of 1297. 30 squared is 900, and 40 squared is 1600, so certainly 37 is already too high to check, so this shouldn't take long even at worst. which it likely is, because the chances get less and less of finding a match as you move up. so next to check is 23, checking in 1297, add it, is 1320, 132, in half is 66, that's just 11, so no. 29, trick for that is 203, added to 1297 is 1500, so no. 31, tripled is 93, 1297 plus 93 is 139(0), plus 31 levels it off at less than 200 so that means a result less than 20, so not 31. 37 has virtually no chance of being it because i think its square is too high, and if we're correct so far, the only option left anyway would have to be a square, which would have to end in 9, but i'll check anyway in case i've made a mistake, 1297 minus 37 is 126(0), in half is 63 (known 9x7) so no. so retracing our steps the final answer would 2x2x3x3x1297"

(300 plus 111) so no. checking 139, ...... 75351 (just tripled the target number as an escape plan), add 139 to right is 7569, and down to 743. i've been really trying to avoid tripling 139 but i guess i have to, 140 tripled (i'm not good at this) 420, minus 3 is 417. (should have had my 117 more handy as a 39 triple there) 743 plus 417 is 115(0) and that's just 23. (no). checking 141 no that's 47, checking 143 not necessary, checking 147 no that's just 49, checking 149 of course. triple it is 447. 2511(0) minus 44(7).. erm.... 2511 minus 44 i hate my self, is 2464 plus 11 is 2475. double, is 48 no 495(0). double is 99(0) and no. checking 151 (149 and 151 are known twins), triple is 453, 25117 plus 453 means 2512 plus 45, 2557 right? plus 453 should end in 1(0), like 256 plus 45, ok 301. minus 151 definite no, after dropped zero you'd be 2 digits. checking 157, this is the last number to check because 159 would be a 3, and 160 squared is bigger than the target, and if everything so far was done correctly then the only available option left would be 157 squared, which should have to end in 9, which would be wrong, but just in case we'll check 157. 25117, down from right, which would mean 2511 minus 15, so 2496, in half goes to 1248, 624, 312, by 3 is 104 and no. so i am afraid here is where we finally meet the (ref: brickwall.mp4\"target=\"_blank)brick wall. so final answer 25117 x 2"

To get back to your original question, yes i would be able to identify the note, because i can always remember the last note i heard, and i knew what that one was, so therefore i will know what the next one is when i hear it. also when doing this on a physical keyboard it is made even easier by the fact that the keyboard is shaped in such a way that you can eliminate about half of the notes just based on shape of the key physically"

And before i forget- to harken back to your original answer, yes absolutely correct, although again i would recommend putting the bass on C. which i'm 90% is what they did but as i said this is just from the way i remember it. Ok i'm going to stop being lazy and just go listen to it since i have already rambled on it for this long: ok yes, they have C in the bass, and F# in there also. which is the best all around compromise. executing the Cdim which as i said would be quite bloody on the distortion but that's the way it goes. it's always a challenge to make this kind of real harmony happen with distortion on (basically anything except 5ths and 4ths will make a mess) but yea, they did exactly what i would recommend. played it right down the middle, using C and F# notes to approximate Cdim in just enough detail to work properly while still keeping the sludge to a minimum"
