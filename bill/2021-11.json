It also doesn't help that I only get to sing when the house is empty, which is maybe only twice a week. I also really want to play the piano ever since I messed around with it a few times in the past but I don't have access to it now and my parents are pretty discouraging when it comes to music because they think it's useless and will only distract me further and isn't profitable enough to bring food to the table, so I definitely can't convince them to buy one anytime soon, nor do I know a close friend who owns a piano (probably because I don't have many friends). I want to get involved with music but I'm currently studying engineering (which I'm also passionate about), which is extremely hard to handle as it  is without bringing music into the picture. I think I spend a good chunk of my waking hours listening to music in the background, but I'm kind of reluctant to explore music theory not only because it's kind of inaccessible but also because once I dig too deep I just become entrenched in it and I don't want to become even more distracted from my studies. The education system in my country also holds this suffocating disdain for anything related to the arts and music, so there aren't many opportunities/resources that I know of. I'm still pretty optimistic about taking up music as a hobby, but the pressure and competition in academics will only increase in the next few years, making it even harder to give time to basically anything else I might be interested in. Anyway, complaining aside, I just need a few tips on how I could build on any crucial skills I might need for playing an instrument or singing because I've had zero training in anything related to music (due to the aforemention ed shitty education system). Also, sorry for making this unnecessarily long (I wanted to give the proper context for my situation).",

But any actual moment in a real song is going to render most of those wrong and a handful of them right, or possibly requiring something not listed here. On an actual songwriting situation, if you find yourself in a scenario where you'd find yourself using this type of logic to find the right chord, i find it usually means you've lost touch with the song at that particular moment. mechanics usually are not what is gonna produce the answers you want, at least in a music/song situation. for that you have to rely on pure magic/miracles, unfortunately"

different\"\n\"i can't believe what i'm seeing, it's more than a dream, and it's more than anyone ever dreamed in history\"\n\"and on the best days you'll believe again that the best dreams can be real again\"\n\n\nfrom the song 'money':\n\n\"it's time for the show\"\n\nfrom the song \"here comes the sun\"\n\n\"here comes the sun, bringing you love and shining on everyone\"\n\"i hope you know that there's no stranger strange enough\" which, paraphrased more clearly, would be something like \"i hope you're aware that every person in this world is a real person, just like you, and everyone would truly love each other if we knew who we all really were\"\n\n\"ding ding ding dang ding ding, put it into words and then\nsend it all over the world\"\n\n\nfrom the song \"it's the first day of school (and i think i might quit!)\":\n\n\"gonna learn some new lessons i won't forget\ngonna write them all down in the language of love\nand then teach them to everyone\"\n\n from the song \"at the airport terminal\":\n\n\"at the airport terminal the planes are landing\"\n\"traveling somewhere and it feels fantastic, rolling across the terminal floor\" (with 'rolling' meaning walking, possibly with a wheeled suitcase)\n\"everybody here is having an unusual day\"....\"in an unusual time zone\".... \"and i'm feeling fine in an unusual way\"\n\n\n\nfrom the song \"just did a bad thing\":\n\"how many times is the game going to change\"\n\"it's the best scheme i have, and that's bad [good] enough for me\", which would refer to any time i've ever truly given my best effort \n\nfrom the song \"the easter bunny told me that christmas isn't real (but santa claus is still jesus)\":\n\n\"everything feels so alive for the very first time\" which means \"[around the christmas/holidays/late-december time, sometimes] there is a deeply warm joyous and magical feeling that i can't quite describe except by using [(ref: everythingfeelssoalivefortheveryfirsttime.mp3\"target=\"_blank)these words, sung with this melody and these chords, like this]\n\nfrom the song 'slow down':\n\"and i think i'm bobblin to a brighter day\"\n\n\nfrom the song 'long long long journey':\n\"it's a long long long journey that we've been on, and it's a long long long story that can be told\"\n \"we've come a long long way\"\n\"there's still a long way to go\"\n\nfrom the song \"when i get older\":\n\"when i get older, i'm gonna be stronger, so i can lift up the whole entire world\" which more correctly translates to \"sometime in the future i'd like to have the ability to deeply inspire many many many people, maybe so much that it might fulfill some of my unmet childhood needs somehow\" \n\n\"and i don't quite know what it means, but it feels like the song knows me\" (this describes any experience of listening to a song that really hits strongly, perhaps beyond my ability to fully understand exactly why) \n\nfrom the song \"i'm best friends with my own front door\":\n\"i saw the sign, i saw the sign, it's a bad bad sign\" which refers to the fact that i realized that i only have 4 more hours to compose the entire remainder of this song, if i wanna have any chance of staying in line with my new extremely ambitious production goal of 1 song/video released every 2 weeks\n\n\"cuz i'm hungry [to achieve my goals] and scared and i can't find the truth [figure out how the hell to do this, because i've been trying for so many years] so i'm leaving [so i don't give a fuck i'm gonna accomplish this NOW]oh, there's my balloon [holy crap i'm actually doing it, it's as if i've just been able to grab onto a balloon that can now carry me up and away from the pit of eternal failure i thought i was falling into]\"  \n\"that's how the game begins, oh, that's how i get home again\" [hopefully this is the beginning of a continued trend of achieving my production goals, which i've been seeking so deeply for so long, as one would seek their true home]\"\n\nfrom the song \"hallelujah\":\n\"hallelujah\" (that's just a true word, it's always true when anyone says it)\n\nfrom the song 'hello sexy pants':\n\"but down in congress, all the boys get mad\" (actually writen like a fictional line, but it happens to be true that \"the representatives on the floor of a 2-party government tend to argue with each other\")\n\"everywhere somebody lonely is still feeling blue\" (i'm just assuming this must be statistically true)\n\nfrom the song 'and the day goes on':\n\"and the day goes on\" which more accurately means, \"and time/life goes on\"\n\"hold on\"...\"stay strong\"... which is just general encouragement i would give to anyone, as time and life goes on   \n\nfrom the song \"La de da de da de da de day oh\":\n\"i don't have enough time to say the things i wanna say [i feel like i'm not going to have enough time to write and produce all the material i want to express, which is mostly because of the high quantity of things that i want to express, combined with the high amount that i care about it which will cause me to take it so seriously that it will therefore probably take me a long time. at least this is currently how i'm feeling in februrary of 2009 as i say this]\"\n\"i wanna write a song\".....\"is that so wrong\" [asking myself this, around february 2009, when i was feeling like i definitely hadn't written enough songs]\n\"La de da de da de da de day oh\" [simulation of what it might sound like, to sing such a song]\n\n\"i went down to the mall, then they closed down the mall\" [written with a fictional spirit, but it's almost completely based on that time i went to my local mall and i noticed that about 75% of the stores in the mall seemed to have suddenly gone out of business, and i didn't know why, and it felt spooky\n\nfrom the song \"outside\":\n\"gonna go out and away from the lines\" (just describing one of my typical creative goals)\n\nfrom the song \"got to know what's going on\":\n\"give me a chance to believe it\" (this is just a general prayer to be able to find genuine truths that can be believed in)\n\"we've got to know what's going on\" which means \"it seems like we all really would like to know what's really going on in the world, and why, and what it all means... or at least i would certainly like to know\"\n\"we've got to know so we can be strong\" which means \"it feels like we'd all probably find a lot of strength in truly knowing and understanding the world\"\n\"whatever it is i'll believe it\" (whatever the realest greatest deepest truth is, i promise to believe it)\n\n\nfrom the song \"in california\":\n\"in california you can smoke marijuana [i'm pretty sure marijuana is now legal in california (for medical purposes at least) (at the time of writing, in 2011) and the reason this seems like interesting news is because marijuana has been illegal in most places for a very long time]\"\"in california you love who you want to [i'm pretty sure there's no gender restrictions on marriage, in california, (at the time of writing, in 2011) which is interesting because i think that's been illegal in most other states for a long time]\"\n\nfrom \"alphabet shuffle\"\n\"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, i'm alive\"\n\nfrom various extremely short videos/songs:\n\"i've been thinking a long time\"\n\"music makes me feel

Then, besides that, just spend a lot of time playing along to recordings where walking should happen. try some things, .... and you may notice it may feel a little uncomfortable if what you're doing does not give you the same \"oh yeah\" feeling that you got before, but, if you keep playing along with those songs, eventually you're gonna find it. you'd have to. it's like a rat finding cheese in a maze"
