Everything after graphics (score, jingles, narration, labels, troubleshoot, etc etc) for history of japan took a total of 30 days. so even if i finish graphics by thursday (wildly impossible) i would have to complete what was 30 days (for a 9 min vid) in 13 days (for a 19 min vid.) so basically that would require more than a 4x speed improvement from what i was doing in dec/jan last year on japan. but, graphics so far has generally been running at 2x speed from last year. i don't know how that's possible. maybe because i'm not trying to make vines every day? not really sure how to account for it, but i guess i have more experience now"
