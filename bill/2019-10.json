            "ok, 2 very important things i have to say about this. 1, yes, you can absolutely use additional keyboards with kbm, all with their own separate keys. i'm currently using 9 keyboards. i will explain the trick i discovered for doing that. but the other important thing i must tell you first is that if you start including wireless keyboards in your setup, you will be in agony city. i had 3 wireless keyboards in the setup and it was a disaster. it's occasionally annoying when a bluetooth keyboard disconnects, but if you have 4 bluetooth keyboards it's going to happen 4 times more often. actually more, because bluetooth just gets messed up when you have too many. i returned all the wireless keyboards and went for wired keyboards only. much more reliable. Ok, now that that hint/tip is out of the way, the secret for getting additional keyboards in kbm is first get Karabiner Elements (this is a key-swapping software). But instead of swapping keys, you are actually going to disable every key. (set it to \"vk disable\".) this may take a while if you go through the popup menus, but if you open the json file you can change it via the text all in one shot (with a little help from kbm of course). Once you have all the keys disabled, go into keyboard maestro and when you make your trigger, instead of \"Hot Key\" trigger, use \"USB device key\" trigger, press a button and it will come right up. This works for almost any keyboard you can imagine, even PC keyboards (although you may never get the function key.) Another secret tip that i will tell you is, if extra keyboards don't work when you first try, or if they don't work when you first boot up, just put the computer to sleep then wake it up. quickest way is to go to the lock screen and then unlock (and i've now zapped that with a macro). only have to do it if i restart, otherwise they work forever. it took me a while to figure that out, i thought they mysteriously just didn't work until i went to lunch. email me if you need any more tips, i have learned a lot so far, and it's a strange world, and i've run into a lot of things i didn't expect, but overall it's been much easier than i expected, considering what i've seen Tom Scott and Taran Van Hemert had to go through. and i'm not even sure if peternlewis is even aware that what i'm doing is possible"

However, I have a feeling that getting a keyboard (I've never played an instrument) could dramatically improve my skills and make everything a lot more fun. But I can't help but feel that this is a foolish thing to hope for. If I'm bad at music now, why would that change if I got a shiny, expensive tool?",

            "i am pleased to announce that if you get a music keyboard, (as long as you don't get one of the toy ones) it will actually sense how loud/soft you hit the notes. so that will be instantly a whole new layer of feels that you have been completely deprived of, because the computer keyboard is not pressure sensitive",

That sounds like a red flag signifying that there is no hope to me. I fear that my keyboard would end up a grand waste of money and space, since I lack the talent needed to operate it.",

No single one is ruining my life (maybe alcohol and weed a little), but the main thing is that I want to be free and natural. \n\nApart from weaning myself off caffeine, I plan to give them all up cold turkey at the same time for 30 days (except for Takeaway food if I am stuck some day). I can't find anything of anyone else doing similar. Do you think it's a bad idea to give up so much so quick? I am thinking of documenting my experience.",

(they are all getting closer together.) then C again (262) then something around D (294?) then another E which rings perfectly in harmony with C (327.5), then, this might be the one you're looking for, something that's like exactly halfway between E and G. so it will be somewhere between F and F#. 360.25. not good. then the next one is another clean G. then some more ugly in between ones. did we get to the one you want yet"

[checking] october 19, 2018. it was just the first line. then when it came time to pick a song, in december, i think i narrowed it down to about 20 songs and then my mistake was that i went through those 20 and narrowed it down again, and it got narrowed down to zero. so i went back to the list of 20 and picked the one i thought was the weakest. and it was that one. then i wrote it, very fast, because i was still attempting to do the 2-week schedule at that time, but i think it had already fallen apart by then. but i think i had convinced myself of some backup plan during that time. it was a long string of failures during that time, regarding the schedule. other than that i don't remember too much about the writing process. it was pretty standard. oh here's something i remember about the writing: the 'hey, what's the name of this game, ..etc.' all of that, after i wrote that i thought it was great but not right for this song. so i spent quite a while trying to come up with a plan B for that, and save that for a different song. i was really convinced that wasn't going to work for this song, as much as i liked it. then eventually i gave into using it. after that i think the writing went pretty smoothly and quickly. the recording process went slightly slower than some of the previous songs because i was just tired of rushing. it was probably rushed until i realized i had blown whatever the latest deadline was, then i was probably a bit more meticulous after that. and the release got screwed up too, because i was aiming for a certain date with the video so i sent it to the stores 2 days before that date, but couldn't finish the video. so the song hit the stores way before the video, by mistake. it was awkward. that turned out to be what the bad thing was"

I'm currently trying to write a song called Birdhead, a long story about a man with a bird in his mind who bounces around his head, making him feel different things for the bird;loathing, euphoria, etc.\nBut I feel as if I've hit a wall with the idea. I quite like it, and i've written a few bars, but the ending is absolutely killing me to write. From one songwriter to another, what's your process for ending songs?",
            "whether it's time for the ending or not, the process is the same. start with a fresh mind, and play the song in real time from the beginning (at the proper tempo. use a metronome). just as you reach the end of the last known part, this is when the answers will present themselves to you. if you can, try to shut off the metronome within 4 bars of when you reach the end. pay very close attention in that moment, within 5 seconds before and after you reach the end. this is when the lightning will strike. try to gather as much as you can from that moment. then, in the following seconds after that, as the moment fades, start to analyze what you think you heard or thought of, and ask some questions to try to narrow it down. then, the only thing you can do is refresh your mind and do it again. the best way to refresh your mind on this is to not hear the song for several hours. but, not everyone has time to waste several hours between run thrus, so what i usually do is start the metronome, walk to the door and touch the door and then return and start. another productivity tip is to be threatened by villains"
