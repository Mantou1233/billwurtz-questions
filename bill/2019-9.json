But I think maybe there might. Like, I turned on the mic and thought out loud it for 52 minutes and thinking of it being able to be as a standalone thing that's releasable. And I keep thinking but i think its maybe just a bit less tiring to do it without that extra minigame. Do you think that minigame should be the norm? that i should strive to be as entert aining/e fficient thoughtwise even when the mics off. Now if that were the case, wouldn't that make my aspiration to have every thought be content? Then how would I organize that, and when? I think maybe theres a benefit of only turning it on in certain times and be able to verbalize what has been inner dialogue only for a while, and that in itself can be an interesting display of words over time. \nI'd like to invite you to be the first listener of the first outloud thought session. (the whole what the hell is a podcast thing rubbed off on me which is why ive avoided the word throughout this, i realize i have a similar thing with \"philosophizing\", its just thinking really, the proper way perhaps, although thats already adding a bit of my biases).\n\nI think not thinking of it as a podcast would limit myself to thinking \"you cant release 3 today!\" If i felt like recording 3 outloud thought sessions in a day. because that doesn't fit my idea of what a podcast is, and  that ma y bias the way i do what i do and how i do it or even worse, how i think of it.\n\nTurns out i came here to ask about why not release unedited reality footage but i really just wanted to talk about my first time doing something that felt natural since I am still riding that high. \n\nHope you're having a bunch of fun and fulfilment playing around with your process and thanks for doing what you do and how you do it, i wouldnt be able to think doing whatever made sense if i didnt see you make sense of whatever you do.\n\nI'd normally go back and add parenthesis to afterthoughts but ive learned its more pure when the words are chronologically put where they are.",

Actually, i'm pretty sure that they will all be recognized as different no matter what. i've never actually tried to use 2 that are the identically exact same model so i'm not sure, but i'm pretty sure it would be fine. then, one slight problem you may run into, next time you restart your computer, if the keyboards don't work when you restart, just sleep the computer real quick and wake it up. then they should work. another side warning, if you do get this working, watch out for the binge-buying of keyboards that may occur as a result"

But now that im trying to actually learn to play drums i find it i can be creative in the arm area but cant really incorporate kick aside from perhaps a 4 on the floor or similar things. as soon as i try to perhaps keep a constant 16ths in highhat and throw some snares in there, i cant really keep up with kick stuff, i feel like perhaps my weight isnt well distributed and whenever i hit the kick i have to rebalance myself some way, any tips for that? And avoiding backpain when playing drums",
            "i'm not sure. i recall that being quite difficult at first but i just kept working on it until i figured it out. i was about 5 years old so i don't have too much memory of how i did it"
