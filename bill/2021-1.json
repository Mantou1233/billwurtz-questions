So i'm going through the (long) list of songs and song ideas to choose from, and, ...... it's just not working. i'm going through the list for hours, not finding one i want to do. So at some point, my brain just said \"what would the song you Want to do now sound like?\" and spontaneously the first line hit me, and i knew immediately that that would be the next song. So i already know it feels right, seems right, means very much to me, etc, but, when i think about it i can also explain why this is. It's like i'm developing a friendliness toward the idea of just... walking out the front door. Just being honest with my situation, ... etc. and picking this next song should be something as easy as just opening the front door, in a friendly manner. Now the second line, again this all came to me instinctually, but i'm just trying to think about it now and explain it.... the second line ('i just closed it but it's opening more') .... this gets deeper because there is the feeling that even if i've failed to notice how easy things could be, ... the door is actually opening on its own. We all know we have the tendency to sometimes overlook the friendly and obvious choices in life, so i think this line gives me a pretty strong feeling because it's like it's saying, even if you miss it, the opportunity will grow more to make you notice it. And the next 2 lines, ('then the cops came and they sent me to jail, but tomorrow i'm gonna open it again'), and again this is not supposed to necessarily work good without the music. so please take this only in the context of the way it sounds in the song. So these 2 lines seem to be basically doubling down on this optimism: the 3rd line is like \"nope, youre gonna get punished for taking the easy route\", then the 4th line shows determination to overcome this. Another bit of optimism is tucked in here also because most jails don't let you open the door. So you're just saying, tomorrow you're gonna get another chance to easily and friendily open a door that was previously assumed to be unopenable."

You would think the other one should then be called \"Stupid Song\", because in fact, that other one (hold my hand / touch my face, etc) seems like more of just \"a stupid song\". that is how i think of that one.
