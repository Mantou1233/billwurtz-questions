            "You responded to a question about tuning systems a while back. The asker wanted to know if you'd ever tried tuning completely in just intonation. You said it's a noble endeavor, but ultimately it's impossible;you couldn't even get a full major scale out of the harmonic series, much less a working system of chromatic harmony.\n\nI've realized something which could go a long way towards solving this problem - I've even composed/arranged some nice music using this concept. (It is by no means my original idea, btw.)\n\nYour problem was that you tried to create a major scale (C major, if I recall) in which each scale degree was only tuned one way, regardless of its 'function'. For example, F would always be the same pitch, whether it was the 3rd of a D minor chord or the 7th of a G7 chord.\n\nThe way I started thinking about just intonation tuning is this: all harmony diatonic to C major can be derived from the harmonic serie s of Bb  (minus 4&#3586;, because C, in this case, is defined as the 9th harmonic of Bb).\n\nIn the C overtone series, we can get a very nice version of the C major triad (1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics), the G major triad (3rd, 9th, and 15th harmonics), the E minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics), and the B diminished triad (15th, 9th, and 21st harmonics).\n\nIn order to get the three remaining triads, you need to use some 'undertones' of C - notes for which C is an overtone. I thought about it like this - if we get C major and E minor triads from the C harmonic series - we can just transpose down a (harmonic) perfect fifth to get F major and A minor triads. Then we can transpose down another perfect fifth to get the D minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb).\n\nSince F-2&#3586; and C are both overtones in the Bb-4&#3586; harmonic series, and since each overtone has a harmonic series of its own (which is still part of the original harmonic series), we can say that a ll harmo ny diatonic to C major can come from the Bb-4&#3586; overtone series and sound great.\n\nHowever, to sound good, notes need to be tuned differently depending on what member they are in a chord. For example, the D minor triad in C sounds great on its own when tuned as the 3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb-4&#3586;. But the D minor triad can also be found within a G9 chord. In this case, a different tuning will be way more consonant - as the 3rd, 7th, and 9th harmonics of G+2&#3586; (which is the 3rd harmonic of C and the 27th harmonic of Bb-4&#3586;). If I remember correctly, this is how you tried to tune a D minor triad a while back - it sounds consonant in the context of a G9 chord, but not in the normal context of a D minor chord.\n\nI realize this is not so practical for live keyboard or fretted instruments, but it's been great for retuning recorded music or composing in a DAW.\n\nThoughts?",
            "it probably doesn't help that i've never seen this symbol before: &#3586;, but essentially, what i discovered boils down to this, speaking in the key of C: the very nature of notes like D, F, G, and A, ... when all used together.... those all need to have certain relationships to each other simultaneously, which is actually impossible. the only way this 'secondary' chord seems to want to work is when it actually feels like all these relationships are true: the F and D have to have a good relationship, the F and A have to have a good relationship, the D and G have to have a good relationship, and the F and C, ... and the G and C, ...... and what i came to discover was that  it's actually this subtlely impossible nature that gives this chord such a longing need to go back 'home' to the 1 chord. kind of blew my mind. i explained all of this as well as i ever possibly could, right (ref: q.php?date=201706141538)here, and like i said, it gave me a deeper appreciation and validation for the 12 tone equal temperment system than i ever thought possible, and i have never questioned it since"

I have been on a bonkers schedule for a little under a year, and in that time I have conquered a considerable chunk of the observable universe thanks to the schedule. It really drags you along and makes you get things done. But I'm thinking of going off the schedule, partially because I just rediscovered the unobservable universe and really wanna go crazy and do something different in there. \n\nOn one hand, this is exciting beyond the belief. Dropping the schedule feels like freedom. (I'm also pretty tired from making content daily, so I love the idea of a change of pace.) On the other hand, I haven't been off-schedule in a long time, and the schedule itself gave me the initial jolt of energy I needed to get going, so I fear the lack of direction/motivation that (sometimes) comes from having no schedule. \n\nYou've done all sorts of schedules and non-schedules... any advice?",

If there is a computer in existence that can do Cycles renders instantaneously, i will spend my entire life savings on it. but i am under the impression that it is not there.

I used 5-digit groups for the first hundred, but after that I found it was better to use variable-length groups -- easier to make up a story around them, harder to mix up the order, and so on.\n\nWhat's weird if I memorized them in my native language, which is not English, and it's really hard for me to recite the decimals in English. I have to pronounce them in my native language and translate the digits into English on the fly, which is hard to do at the same time. I memorized the sounds of the numbers, not the numbers themselves. I never decided to do that, it's just how I naturally did it. I wonder if other people memorized the shapes instead, and would have an easier time saying them in a different language by just visualizing the numbers instead of having to pronounce them internally.\n\nI'm not a musician but I'm curious as to how you learn a song. Probably you  don't ju st recall the specific notes or chords, but some higher-order pattern? Is this something you can explain in simple words?",
            "as long as i've heard a song more than 10 or 20 times, over the course of a few days, i automatically learn it and could not unlearn it. but the tricky part is if i have to learn (memorize) a song on short notice. for that, i absolutely just make a chart and then read it. i am pretty much bullet proof that way, in that case i would only have to hear a song once, i just write it down the first time. but in the rare case the director may say 'absolutely no reading' .... well ........ i'd be fucked. until the age of A.R. glasses"

I just started my life and it feels like I still don't have enough time. I love playing the ukulele, guitar, tenor guitar, and piano (I want to pick up the bass and drums too lmao) but I am really bad at most of them and I don't feel as if I can master them quick enough, and I feel like it'd be too late for me to get lessons on them. As well as I have loads of recording of songs that I have started but I don't know what to do with them, I don't have any type of recording or editing software, and I don't even know what type to get. It feels like I'm just stuck in this hole of, \"I want to do it, but I don't have the  means t o do it. \" And I really want to try to make music for a living. I really hope this hasn't gotten too confusing, but I want to be a successful musician, like you, but I don't know where to start or what to do, and you're one of the only famous people who like actually responds to, pretty much, all of their fans.

Also it may be different if your main instrument is a lead instrument - in that case you might want to know how to read melodies. And in general, i would recommend learning rhythmic notation, because often you will see rhythmic figures written in charts, and also it will be a very valuable tool when talking about the material with other musicians, you can refer to different rhythmic figures. and it would also help to know the names of the notes"
