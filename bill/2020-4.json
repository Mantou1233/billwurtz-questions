I've been getting back into creating music recently after a several years hiatus and I'm finding I am running with an idea for between 10 and 30 minutes or so before I can really move on to another totally different one. If i try earlier than that it is too similar. This is just idea Gen stage not songwriting so it feels way too slow. Any advice?",
            "if you are looking for ways to come up with more different ideas quicker, you could try using various random prompts. a random image. a random word. maybe even a random song, and make it a goal that you are going to write a song in some way related to that song but definitely not that song. or you could use a movie as a starting point. you could even have a totally different type of session where you just come up with different types of starting points. then another type of session where you go through each of the starting points you came up with, and use them. you can use anything as a starting point, but ironically what often happens is if you generate ideas for a while, even if you seem like you're not getting enough, often as soon as you stop and do something else the ideas will fall on you. the truth is that ideas are everywhere, in every molecule. at the rate of about a kajillion ideas per molecule. so if you ever think there are not enough, the ideas will wait for you to stop paying attention and then laugh in your face, flaunting their abundance at you. the question is will you be quick enough on the button, to catch them, regardless of whether you are in the shower, a business meeting, in court, ........ and if the answer is yes then you know you're really in the game"

And my goal was to make a video of just a black line moving horizontally across a white background. I used MS Paint, drew a line. Took a screen shot and saved it. Moved the line the tiniest smidge forward. Took another screen shot and saved it etc etc etc. Tried stringing all the screen shots together in MovieMaker for the final product. Well, it took me an ungodly amount of time to do this. I had to make and save approximately 1 zillion screen shots. And the final product was trash. It just looked like a choppy slideshow of a bunch of pictures of a line. No fluid motion (which was my goal). I don't know what to try now. I'm super frustrated and disheartened. My plan was to learn how to just make simple shapes moving across across a blank background and then gradually move forward towards more complex motion and m ore deta iled characters/backgrounds... But I can't even get a damn line to move across the screen with fluid motion. I know I'm not exactly using state of the art technology here but if I can't figure out how to do something extremely simple on an extremely simple program, investing in some fancy animation software probably isn't the smartest move... sorry for ranting at you, bill. I'm just upset.",

For this particular situation, you'll want to look for something called \"keyframes.\" Most video software has it. it will allow you to pick a point in time and space for the image to be, and then pick another point in time and space, and it connects them linearly (or, for your convenience and pleasure, sometimes it will do use a cringey curve algorhythm). If your software actually cannot do keyframes (which i think it can), i'm sure there is some other very basic and simple software that is within your budget that can"

(I'm not wrong, CHECK any of those pages and see for yourself. billwurtz.com/reality for example) So that means you have at least once been awake in all those hours, and thus all hours (and most presumably minutes) of the day AND night. I know you sleep, because sleep is important (and multiple people already asked if you sleep), but my conclusion after seeing all these hours of the day AND night was: sometimes you sleep in the daytime, and sometimes you sleep at night, ANY hour, you name it, you have at least once been both awake and asleep (not on the same day) in that hour.",
            "are you suggesting that there is anyone in this world (of a medium age) who has actually never been awake at a certain time of the day",
            "Normal people sleep ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY at night.",
            "i'm not so sure about that, especially since the invention of the light bulb",

There's only one problem. When I sleep, I feel like I've skipped a certain period of time (usually 8 hours). This is caused by my brain being unconscious.",
            "yes, i admit, that can seem like a nuisance, but that's just the way we are",
            "However this only works at night for some reason. (I know what I said earlier, normal people sleep ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY at night, but I myself, in particular, can't deal with being stuck in the routine every day. It just feels like an infinite loop, and I'm sick of it.) Anyway, my question is: HOW do you sleep in the daytime (or did in 2008-2016 for example if you do not anymore)?",
            "i think you will find that sleeping becomes quite easy if you have already been awake for 16 hours or more",
            "I tried this, but I ended up being awake, bored, and with nothing to do for 8 hours, and I just keep telling myself to go to sleep until my sleep time period is over, and I tried my hardest to become unconcious, but nothing worked, so I had to wait out the time period minute by minute. Second by  second.",
            "this sounds like exactly the situation you would be in if you were trying to sleep after sleeping too recently, such as less than 14-16 hours ago. You yourself pointed out that you are not thrilled by sleep. so it is not a surprise to me that you are finding it impossible to sleep when you don't actually even want to",
            "I repeat, my question is: HOW do you sleep in the daytime (or did in 2008-2016 for example if you do not anymore)?",

And don't just decide to respond with \"good god this must have taken ages to write\" or anything off-topic. ANSWER the question, and tell all of us how you sleep/slept so unpredictably (sometimes in the daytime, sometimes at night),",
            "i'm not seeing your argument that it is unpredictable. for example, look at the months. sometimes it's january. sometimes it's february. sometimes it's march. I think at one time or another, it has probably been every different month. Does that mean the months are unpredictable? maybe, but there is not sufficient evidence here",
            "because, again, this is a serious issue (at least on my part), I'm fed up with the standard sleep-at-night day-to-day routine.",
            "if you want to sleep in the day, then by natural extension this means you would be awake at night. You have tried sleeping in the day, but from your story, it sounds like you had already been asleep the preceding night. which would naturally make it senselessly impossible to sleep during the following day. However, if you had been awake for the duration of the previous night, it seems it would be quite easy to sleep during the day. Have you considered trying that",

I have always felt like there was this slight pretentiousness living inside me about the music that I like. Like if it didn't have extended harmony or weird changes or complicated rhythms it was stupid, but only SOMEWHAT. And I never really liked this about myself but it always felt true and I had a hard time liking other, lets just say more popular sounding music. But listening to your music has made a huge change within me. Like I would never have been into a song like New Canaan even a year ago but now here I am hearing the music and enjoying it and experiencing it like how music should be experienced! And I just feel so much more open to the worl d when i t comes to writing my songs and all the opportunities that are out there.

Some mud may be necessary to be cut via EQing (if used in the wrong areas), but it seems like a valid production technique when trying to add some density while maintaining the harmonic colour, if you will.",

Actually, what i would really recommend is, after doing the drums first, send it to the chordal instruments, then send it to vocals, then send it to bass, then send it back to the drummer with drums muted and a very strong click (oh i forgot to mention you absolutely must have the click in there from the start), then send it back to the chordal instrument(s) and have them re-do that, with the new drums included, then maybe send it to bass to have that redone, then back to vocals, keep going around like this and have the people re-do their parts each time, because each time it gets closer and closer to creating the illusion of people actually playing together, because now they are hearing each other... even better, they are hearing each other do what they did while hearing each other. but i just realized you probably already knew all this. but as far as acoustics, just remember that some people spend millions of dollars on ways to try to deliberately simulate bad acoustics. hope that helps"

In a 3D environment such as history of the world, this is done with video files. render the globe moving as you want, with the full map on it, then replace the globe map with a same sized map with only the desired territory, and the rest black. re-render the exact same sequence, with exactly the same start and end time. then import both videos into your 2D timeline, and stack them, and key out the black, as before"

Basically whenever I do anything, I feel like I have to understand it perfectly, and not just like perfectionism but like a need to see how it all works from scratch. Like I'm making a computer translator, and basically I need medium to reflect semantics. But then I get so stuck on how semantics works and I still haven't continued coding cause I'm trying to understand the underlyingness of how things work. Or like if I have to do math work, I think of the nature of numbers, how almost all operations are defined recursively in the end including addition and all, and I don't get anything done for a long time. (I'm not trying to call myself smart;I really am a lazy dumbass in the end) But in the end it's good though and not a complete waste of time, cause it feels like you get it all even if countless people have thought of the same stuff before you. And also in the end this is practic al in so me way, as actually understanding is like building foundations for a house rather than being quick to build some that that you're not sure how it stays up. Even if the people who build without foundations are more efficient really. So my guess is that as you do these 3D stuffs, you're trying to understand the stuff cause glossing over it or trusting other's people's things without understanding them just that just feels wrong. I hope I don't sound like a psychologist or something assigning a guess, I'm really just guessing a guess.",

But, there's also a secondary piece of software that i've been using in addition, ever since about 2016, to do some of the 3D elements, and sometime last year when starting on a music video i just felt deep inside that i wanted to try starting off the entire video from the 3D program, just to see what happens. i've always known 3D is a nightmare mindfuck timesink, but something must have clicked in my biological timeclock or something, and i realized it was my destiny to just jump into it, and apply all the same principles of brutal simplicity that had allowed me first enter the video making realm (an equally impossible mindfuck, back then, having had no experience). So i fell hopelessly in love with this new realm, despite some of the unthinkable challenges, and then it occured to me that this is obviously the time when i am supposed to make the jump to a new system. there is literally every reason to do it, and equally many reasons 'not' to 'not' do it. it's kind of like going through puberty. your body says it's time to change and the change happens. and let's just say that the transition has set into motion so many more ridiculous and exciting developments than i had ever could have expected, and yet needed so desperetly all along. it's like when a tree grows for 10 years under a small shelf and then the shelf breaks and the tree suddenly explodes in an upward direction. could be awkward at first but you know it's gotta happen. if you've known me, you'll know i've been through this many times before",
