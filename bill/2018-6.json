Wouldn't that mean that, technically, that first note shouldn't be released until the exact same moment that the 2nd note is played? If you have to lift up from the 1st note to play the 2nd note, then wouldn't you be cutting the duration of the the quarter note slightly short just for that little tiny moment between the notes? Is that little moment so negligible that I shouldn't even think about that? And then, the natural sustain of the instrument/sound could effect that as well? Like sometimes it would be impossible to sustain the first note until the exact moment the 2nd note is played (like if you're playing 2 fretted notes on the same string of a guitar or bass that are farther apart than what you can reach without moving your hand)... If I want to have 2 instruments play the same line, would it be more accurate to think of that 1st quarter note as, like a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth rest (or maybe even an eighth note, dotted sixteenth and a 32nd rest) so that the release of the notes happen at the exact same time? I've never really thought about this before, but now that I am thinking about it, I'm confusing myself. When I read rhythmic notation I'm usually thinking primarily about where the notes hit, more so than the duration of each note. Like if I had 4 quarter notes, I'd now that each note should be played on the beat, but I'd probably play the 4 quarter notes no different than then if it were written as alternating dotted eighth notes and sixteenth rests (unless it's a really slow tempo) Obviously for something like a quarter note and a quarter rest, I wouldn't play the same way as a half note.. but when you get down to those little itty bitty tiny moments in between the notes, do those essentially not matter rhythmically?",

Do i just listen and play more?",

After about 100 more songs, you probably won't even have to listen to the song, you will be able to do it from memory. after about 1000 songs, you will probably be able to hear someone singing the melody for a song you have never heard before, without hearing the chords, and figure out what the chords should be. after 10,000 songs, you should be able to play along with them on the first try, never having heard the song before, and have them think you already knew the song"

Then, go in and add bass as needed, for bass-capable systems. but first make sure it completely stands strong with no bass. we all know it's possible, like i said, they made music for game boy and it was damn good. and when i say gameboy i mean also millions of phone apps, and ringtones, that have been popular since then. but if you design the whole song on a system where you can hear the bass, you're taking a risk, because you never know if the song is still gonna be strong enough if you delete the entire bass. i've taken that risk for my entire career because i'm mostly too scared to think about it. but i think it's a good time to try to take care of it because phone/tablet speakers aren't going to get any larger, and there is no technological breakthrough any time soon that will allow bass to exist at that size. but don't worry, i will go into bass mode and additively put the bass where it needs be, after i get it so it is solid basslessly"

Teachers help with this because over time they acquire tons of dead easy songs, hard songs, and the whole gradient between.\nAlso, teachers provide a shortcut to valuable knowledge, like \"the more you do it, the better you get\" or \"start simple and work your way up\" or \"remember to take breaks\".\nIn short, teachers are like grocery stores. Sure, you could go farm-to-farm trying to get what you need, but it's much easier to go to one source that is experienced in getting you what you need.\nRebuttal?",

            "Hi Bill,\n\nI have this really bad habit of starting really cool projects (at least, it seemed exciting stuff at the time), but then never finishing really any of them because they are displaced by new, current, in the moment things to think about and plan and try to do. It's like I forget how awesome the ideas felt to me when I came up with them. I've tried your strategy of just cateloging and recording every damn thing I think of, but I never end up going back to listen to them, and meanwhile I'm neck deepin something else that caught my attention, whether it's figuring out how the fuck math works, how the fuck computers work, how the fuck communication (e.g. talking politely, teaching) works, and also how the fuck the world works.",
            "you are going through the exact same thing i went through for many years",
            "realize of bad habits to have, this is definitely not the worst I could have. But it's just so fucking annoying when you are going to bed at 2 in the morning to wake up for school at 6:30 and you feel like you've done nothing of substance, big and meaningful. Like I could be doing so much more, making the world just a little more cooler (I'd like to think), but just controlling the urge to swim deeper into the ocean even though you just dragged yourself out of the deep end is hard somehow. I can't shift from thinking \"But what? But why?\" to \"time to make shit.\"\n\nAnd really? I'm realizing that I'm okay with myself still humming a long, looking at and thinking about interesting stuff, because at the end of the day it is fun. But how exactly can I keep this up forever?This is fun, but I've kind of had the same kind of fun for a while now. Can I please just switch?",
            "you will switch gradually, as your desire to switch continues to grow to firey new heights",
            "I'm honestly kind of just insecure, because now I'm just thinking, do I even know what I'm saying right now? Is it really that big of a deal? Even when my thoughts are trying to say otherwise. There is a disconnect here between feelings and thought, and I'm not sure what is going on. And no, those were not the good words to use there...that's not quite what I meant to say... I'm not sure if it's just sleep dep. making everything wobbly and unfocused, or my brain purposely trying not to think about this.\n\nI hate the feeling when I see both people that I follow online and people around me actually doing things,",
            "this is first hand proof that you are hard wired for success, beyond a shadow of a doubt. your ambitions are through the roof, and your standards are on the ceiling. and you think about it morning day and night, and in between",
            "nd when other people around me are like \"dude just be lazy and stop caring so much\" IF I CARE SO MUCH WHY AM I GOING TO BED AT 3 JUST TO FINISH A GOD DAMN SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT well, let me take that back. I didn't start until 1, but I could have finished much earlier if I would have just half-assed it which would still have gotten me an A. And I was running away from starting it because I had no idea how to do it.",
            "classic",
            "I'm trying to learn Debussy's L'isle Joyeuse over the summer, attempting to make a karaoke track to \"and the day goes on\" with a DS soundfont I have, digitizing a Bible of sorts (not religious) with cool layout, pictures, and design, making a movie with my friend starring King Lear, and creating computer programs to help with scheduling. (There's a circle here somewhere...) Oh, and writing college essays. The sad thing is, there is more than enough time to do all this stuff, and more time to do more, during the summer. I know this. Everything would be great if I actually worked on it, instead I'm not. And I know the answer to this is that I'm on the right track, or that there is a tipping point. It's just so frustrating, and scary, because I don't know if I want to see myself if I ever go past that tipping point.\n\nI don't want to be boxed into everything. But I'm kind of wondering if I do need some sort of box to be able to continuously work on stuff.",
            "i think you will find that the box is just going to be your name. you. i know it's tempting to live a thousand parallel creator's lives, but there's barely enough time to live 1. so i think an umbrella strategy might ultimately work best for you here. as soon as you get fully comfortable with the fact that you are mr. do-it-all, you can start treating yourself like a king and just plan the task sequence from there.",
            "I can't think of really a whole project to finish in a day, like your schedule when you were starting.",
            "that is why it is so vitally important to start very very short, small, and simple. there is a whole host of things that are learned AFTER you get your feet on the ground and doing things, that you never could have learned before. to sum it up into 2 points, first you will learn how far away actual real creations are from the vivid splendor you have imagined. but close on the heels of that is point 2 which is realizing how insanely much CAN be done, even just using the simplest tools available to you. learning happens fast from project to project, and the good news is, all your interests will find their way onto the menu. as long as you keep the train moving, you will surely hit all the stops and more. did i mention start small, trains are heavy",
            "Sorry, this kinda like turned into many different issues. I can't even lay a finger on a specific problem I'm having. Hate to bother you with this, but it's just a big frustration for me that I haven't changed. Well, that's not true, I have changed a little, I'm looking at *literal* trash less often...\n\nEven if you don't reply, thanks for being an outlet for my thoughts. Sorry for this huge mess of a ramble, I'm also very tired, as I'm sure you are too.\n\n-IronLotus"

            "Do you agree with this analysis of \"hello sexy pants\"?\n\n\"This whole masterpiece is a analysis of late stage capitalism and its unnability to satisfy the alienated consumer it produce in the very negation of its production.\n\nWhat is the \"pants\" ? It's the commodified product par excellence, by owning the pants, you don't only own an object, you wear it and thus you make the object a part of your own identity, while you objectify yourself in the processus : at the end, the pants own you. That's how love work between humans, but that's also how it's manufactured in our spectacular society. As Baudrillard said \"seduction represent mastery over the symbolic universe while power represents only mastery over the real universe\"\n\n\"Where'd you get those pants ?\" said the cash cow : someone finally said that the king is naked. Indeed, where did those pants come from ? Isn't it the product of a bengali kid ? More deeply here relies a critique of commodity fetishism : alienation make us forgot that we, as humans, are the producers of this pants;and just like the african tribes who forgot that they were the creators of their fetish, our production became our new god. No response to the quiet scream of the cow, just \"hello\", again and again. \"I wanna know why it hurts so bad\" : The ignorance of this alienation brings pain, we feel depossessed without understanding why, and when we see the pants we need to possess it badly by the act of consumption, since we don't feel that we own it by the act of production. We even have the feeling that the pants can \"make a wish come true\" : that's the final stage of the fetishised entity put above our heads. \"Hello sexy pants did you know that I like your pants ?\" : The commodity has become more than just pants.\n\nAnd in Congress all the boys get mad, and not because they oppose capitalism, bill wurtz is more subtile : the politicians are mad because they loose control over the system, they no longer have a word to say in the direction, just like everyone, they become simple executant of the will of the Capital.\n\nWhile nature is out there, represented by the squirrels, all we can see is the omnipresent modern propaganda of the media, in this TV everything looks fine and nice, there is happy faces everywhere and it tells us to be friends, but in reality it's divising humans, humans are no longer \"friends\", they are actors in the representation of a friendship mediated by the society of the spectacle, in wich being a friend is just a question of posture, of \"friendly stance\".\n\nAnd then the capital tell you that thanks to him you can go all around the world, and indeed it became \"easy as 1, 2\" to go through the hills of France : tourism - human circulation packaged for consumption, a by-product of the circulation of commodities - is the opportunity to go and see what has been banalized. The economic organization of travel to different places already guarantees their equivalence. The modernization that has reduced the time involved in traveling has simultaneously reduced the real space through which and to which one can travel. And, as Debord pointed it \"while eliminating geographical distance, this society produces a new internal distance in the form of spectacular separation.\"\n\nAfter that the TV subtly reminds you the danger in criticize our society : you are against us ? Do you want to live in North Korea ? However, the nature of the commodity reaffirm itself soon after, North Korea is - like any other places and activities - something that must be subjugated to the ever expanding market, we need to shake some hands even here, for business - and pleasure - since the two must become the same unique thing But there still is hope, We all could wake up in the morning and enjoying a simple yet meaningful life. But is this true liberation ? Isn't it a way to distract us from the true solution wich must be collective ? Isn't this a pass to being lonely and to feel \"blue\" ?\n\n\"At the clothing store nobody tells you the whole world is changing\" : everything is said, capitalism don't tell you about the world it is making, you're here to buy as a mindless robot, you don't need to understand that the world is changing, in fact you mustn't;the world is changing by itself, by the forces of the Capital;and no one truly understand how : that's the ultimate \"proletarization\", proletarization in its essence is the privation of knowledges for a subject and the privation of a subject for knowledges, first we lose the ability to understand what we are producing, but in consequence we now lose the ability to understand what we are consuming, it's a vicious circle, the circle of the commodity. So buy your clothes and become your products, even if the clothes is always changing, seasons by seasons, we are not even able to see it, we are trapped in the phenomena wich don't allow us to see the noumena, the Capital instill in us the feeling that we are living in a never ending-present wich always existed and wich will always exist \"At the grocery store someone will tell you that what changed is you\" : that's the response of the Capital, it's not the world that is changing, it's you, you are the one who is not in phase with the perfect and immuable \"present\" of the spectacular society, so stop to complain and accept your fate, submit yourself to the system, learn it's rythm or accept that you are excluded from it;and why the grocery store ? Because the control of the spectacle is in the everyday life, in the most basic consumption.\n\nThe pants are already forgotten, in this insatiable run for consumption, now we have a new fetish to love : the lamp, a lamp wich is so godly that it can \"light the whole darn sky\", but only \"at 2:pm\", never forget that everything is temporal in this world, and again, the Congress could do nothing against it, it could not even replicate the modern worship of the commodity, the light became black down there.\n\nSimon is probably the most interesting and intriguing character of this song, he is the double bipolarity of capitalism : he is the worker wich face its own alienation, without meaning in his work he can't \"remember anything he've been doing\", because of the economic functionnement of capitalism, and perhaps worse, because of the ideological functionnement of capitalism he can't remember \"anything he remember\", \"everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation\" we don't live our own life, we live the life of the Capital by the Capital for the Capital, we are just actors of a stageplay wich was written before we were born, instead of being the actor of our own artwork, we don't have our own memories since we're just travelling from one representation to another. Represented by the graphics behind him, Simon is nothing but a number among other. And the graphics also indicate us that Simon is also the financial world, the highest abstraction of the Capital, he don't know where he come from, he don't know who he is, is just here doing what he is made to. And there is the dramatical problem : They (the worker and the trader) don't care, as long as they find out what they're - supposed - to do. The \"supposed\" is the key to understand it fully, supposed according to who ? To what ? To the commodity, we don't think anymore, we don't put ourselves in an historical and ontogenetic approach, we are just here, doing what the God-Capital tell us to do, we become nothing more than a cog in a machinery that depass us all, that kill every bit of liberty in us. Simon IS the system, he is the one that tell us what to do, as showed by the use of \"Simon Says\", Simon wants to fully become us. He want us to become him. The reward ? A sign on your checks.\n\nAlso, the lamp is very sexy.\"",

I know that everyone is different and no advice works perfectly for everyone (it is as unique as the person) but I wanted to know if this was... \"normal\"? or that it might be an expected step? I hope that makes sense;it's been really weird and I'm a little scared that I might fall into a dark pessimism before bursting with creativity.
