(https://youtu.be/GC6nSX67Q-4?t=31 i linked to the relevant part at 31 sec). Listen to the guitar melody, it has these notes in it, ignoring all the little thrills and slides, - F# B A C#. And then the second guitar comes in and harmonizes over the first and I figured out that the harmony is a minor third (correct me if im wrong). But here's the confusion: the notes in the harmony are A D C# E, and A D E are all a minor third of the corresponding notes in guitar 1 - F# B C#. BUT the C# in guitar 2 is a MAJOR THIRD away from the A in guitar 1. And it sounds bloody cool. What's going on here, why isn't that C# a C, and why does changing that one note make it sound so much better?",

Using the G chord, we have G7 = G9 no9, Gadd9 = G9 no7, Dm6 = B hdim7 = G9 no1, and I sometimes also see G9 approximated in 4 voices by leaving out the 5th.

The part that I can't stop going back to over and over is when you talk about schedules, which are absolutely crucial for *getting things done*. Without them I've also noticed that there are just so many options, and you end up being all over the place, and one thing can go on forever.\n\nNow, I'm pretty darn good at planning and making schedules, but where I mess up is in the execution. I can't stick to my plans mainly because I get distracted. As soon as whatever was planned on the schedule starts getting a bit difficult, or uncomfortable, I stop doing it and switch to a non-planned activity such as reading the news on twitter, or some other lame thing like that.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I really want to do the thing s that I 've planned and are on the schedule, I like those things and I feel enthusiastic about it, it's just that whenever it gets hard, I'm too weak.\n\nWhat's the secret to stick to the schedule no. matter. what.?\n\nI don't want to get old and be like: \"arghasdh...

'bad thing' was excluded way earlier, because it was one of the least good. so after having eventually excluding them all for not being good enough, i realized i was at a dead end and the clock was running out so for a twist i just kind of picked one of the worst ones, and wrote it extremely quickly. this was actually an advantage, because when you try to make a bad thing good in a very short amount of time, you are forced to bring out your very best. it's kind of like when it's 8:59 and the bread store is closing at 9:00, you will discover some automobile maneuvering skills you perhaps didn't know you had, just to get that bread",

About four years ago I finally stepped into making and singing music after growing up in an family that believed music making, esp singing, is the realm of an elite few talented people. I always rebelled against this idea in my heart because but didn't participate in misic making until I left that environment about 4 yrs ago. anyways, after 4 years of singing w a vocal group I could just feel that my voice, my ears, improv and other abilities had become quite strong. About 6 mo ago I leveled up again in my understanding of music and began making/recording my own music and performing more on my own time, not just with my group. So, I know my strongest suit is harmony and singing with others, but recently at a mic night I sang a song (used a mic) by myself, no accompanymnent, which is a first for me. Icould hear myself during and it I was delighted that my voice both sounded and felt good, which i have learned are some of several markers that you are making a good, strong sound. But a friend recorded it, then sent it to me later. I watched it to see what it sojnded like from an audiences persective and it actually didn't sound great, not bad but not good. There were a few notes I thought I nailed but were actually a little shaky, and overall tone was not as strong as I had felt it was in the moment. This devastates me because my body and my ears to ears told me it sounded nice while I was performing, but the actual recorded audio denies this...I feel shattered. So now I am wondering if I should just halt all my musical persuits,",

            "this may sound boring and technical but i wrote some of it on a writing session, then wrote a bit more of it on a writing session, and then finally wrote the remainder of the song during a writing session. that's the short story. the long story is, i was doing a writing session many many years ago after many years of not doing writing sessions. actually it felt like i had never done a writing session before, it had been so long. i know i did many years before that, but it seemed so far away and i'm not quite sure how i ever did it. too long ago to remember really, and the world had surely changed since then, mine and everyone else's. so i was doing something which i think might have been totally new, i was just writing. not in the recording thing, not trying to record and write at the same time, just writing. like on paper, and i had 1 instrument to play along to what i was singing, and weirdly it was an unplugged bass. which doesn't quite make sense but it was a quiet room and i was just using it to indicate chords. not play chords, but just play the bass notes to indicate chords. so a few things were written on that session, including a thing that looked like (ref: snow32909.jpg\">this. you may mostly recognize this verse, sort of mostly. but the chorus it goes to on this page (not shown) is completely different, and wraps up to a surprise twist ending very quickly, making it a probably less than 1 minute piece called, presumably, 'in the snow.' the snow not really being the chorus, the snow being the twist ending. so that's 'in the snow.' fast forward maybe 3 and a half years. i am getting my life togther and going through the stacks and stacks of writing sessions i've done over the years, and getting it all organized and doing writing on them, for days and days and days and days and weeks, a many months long writing-only period i call 'writing tare' when i worked only on writing for almost a year, and not starting any new ones, just updating/continuing/finishing/fixing on existing songs and fragments. very early on in this process, around september 2012, i took a look at 'in the snow,' made some small adjustments to the verse to make it stronger, the pre-chorus got changed from 'i'm gonna count to 3' to instead 'i'm gonna write a song'. therefore the old chorus didn't make sense (something about counting to 3 i assume) ditched it and wrote a brand new much brighter stronger chorus, which <a href=\"https://billwurtz.com/la-de-da-chorus.jpg)as you can see seems to be nearly exactly the la de da chorus. and then it sat there burning a hole in my shelf, as a ray of sunshine with a high standard i suppose i was afraid to live up to. fast forward to 2017, i've been actually recording songs, and videos of many different types, for many years at this point, and over the years the writing list had grown out of control, mostly from 2010 to 2013 but still even more later, so most of the time doing a song (recording + video) means going through the list and finding something i want to do. in post-hotewig i had made the decision to allow fragments to be picked (songs where only partial writing was done) so as to get something almost entirely new and finish the writing on the spot and record it. out of something like 400 to choose from, i manually got it down to about 41 finalists, planning to do a random number selection to choose. but i narrowed it down again manually to 27, and with agonizing fear i chose the number and it picked la de da. and then the next day i had terrible cold feet about it, thought it was lame and stupid. switched it to a slow song, switched it to another song, lost my mind, wasn't sure, and then somewhere around getting into the haircut chair (was planning on doing real video performance footage for this one) i was pondering a second verse after the bright la de da chorus, and the first 3 mall lines tumbled into my head quite readily. so at least that mostly solidified the song choice for me and gave it an extra push toward validity, and from there the decision was finalized and i quickly finished the writing and then went into production which took agonizingly long because it turns out going on camera in front of zillions of people can be scary if you haven't been doing it regularly",

Genuinely curious what you think about that though, honestly the whole concept seems a bit wacky to me but i like to entertain wacky ideas sometimes I guess.
