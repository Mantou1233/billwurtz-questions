A neat hack i found was to improvise the lyrics. i always seemed to sound much better when the words were genuinely made up at the time i'm singing them, instead of scripted. and if they are scripted, you have to ask a lot of similar questions that an actor would ask, about your character and your situation that you are trying to envoke. but aside from that, i also found out later that simply the more time singing makes you better. then much later on, a voice doctor told me that clearing your throat is bad, so i stopped doing that, and i also picked up a boring warm up exercise which i do on morning walks"

            "first, you must try to convince the song you are actually NOT trying to write it. make up a contract agreement that you and the song can sign, that says \"i am NOT trying to 'write' this song, and will not make any attempts to do so!\" and you and the song both sign it, and maybe you'll have some fine print located somewhere near the bottom of your left shoe or something. Then, as you sit down casually next to your melody, 'NOT' appearing to have any intention or desire to write the song, .... just begin trying phrases and sentences with the melody. don't worry about what's \"good\" or not yet, just start saying anything that comes to mind, with that melody. You will automatically start getting a feel for what the mechanics are (lyrically) of this melody. you'll see which kinds of words and phrases seem to always want to go in certain parts. and you'll just be internalizing the melody subconsciously, in the linguistic part of your mind. Then, put that aside, and just tell a story in your own words of what this melody is. When did you think of it? how did it make you feel? describe anything you know or feel about this melody and its origins. Sometimes you can even catch a glimpse of the exact essence of what the melody seems to be saying, even if it's the totally wrong number of words or syllables and has no physical resemblence to the shape or size of the melody. if you get this, definitely write it down. just try to PARAPHRASE (non-musically, in normal non-lyrical language) exactly what you think the melody seems to feel like it's saying. Now at this point the song will probably start to think you are trying to write it, with all the effort you've been putting in, so you will probably need an updated contract to assure everyone even more clearly that you are 'NOT' 'TRYING' to 'write' the song. then after that it's pretty much a waiting game. if you can stay calm and be patient enough for the song to forget you are trying to write it, that's when it's gonna happen"

Because new song ideas are so new, you haven't heard them very much, so you are likely to forget exactly how it went. i am not comfortable trusting that the next time i look at it i'll remember the exact melody. so i must document it exactly. Whether this is done with notation or not, it doesn't really matter to me. it can be done with recording references, and nowadays i always use recording references, because we live in such a digital world. but for a long time i was using handwritten notation. The only times i ever do it with notation is when i have no instrument near me. i used to go to the library and put in earplugs and write songs that way. nowadays, when writing songs at the keyboard, i just make recorded references and cite them in the lyric sheet. The same goal is accomplished: to exactly document the lyric, melody, and chords"

And this is actually a problem i can sympathize with, because, if you want it so so so bad, how could you possibly stop thinking about it? but i think ultimately this IS what's going to happen. you WILL be able to calm down. whether you want to wait patiently or whether you keep kicking and screaming in desperation for a while and eventually exhaust yourself, and after all that is said and done, it WILL come. this may seem hard to believe but it wants you every bit as bad as you want it. it just really really needs you to be as open minded as possible, in order for it to feel comfortable arriving, because that's when it knows it can blow your mind the most. which, presumably, is what you've requested"

The good news is, i have the (ref: https://billwurtz.com/i%20like.pdf\"target=\"_blank\">original chart of when i wrote it, all on paper, years before i ever recorded it. The bad news is, it's not guaranteed to be entirely accurate because when i record a song, i am potentially allowed to invoke the 'suck' clause and change some of the details IF i thought it sucked. but the good news is, i'm looking at the chart right now and it seems extremely accurate. the bad news is that the end was re-written (not shown on this chart) but the good news is that the new ending is only 4 bars, in replacement of 27 bars on the chart, and those new 4 bars, if they were written in this chart language, would not have shown any chords, it would be notated as rap only, in a similar notation language to the 27 bar ending you do see. so you wouldn't have seen any chords from the chart there anyway. The bad news of course, is that for sections like that, in this chart language, you never see any chords, and chordal decisions for those types of sections are made during the recording. However the good news is that the only other part like this would be the intro, and i think i actually did not use any chords there in the recording either. However the bad news is, for that new 4 bar section which occurs in the recording but not the chart, there IS chordal information there (arranged when recording) that would certainly NOT be reflected in the chart. Also the other bad news is that the final recording is not guaranteed to be done in the same key as the chart, BUT the good news is, in this case it actually was. The good news is, i'm pretty sure i must have some sort of document somewhere that indicates the writing of those last 4 bars, either a written update or a recorded writing demo, but the bad news is i can't seem to find it and now i think it doesn't exist, and it seems more likely that i was feeling brave enough to actually re-write a 4 bar ending on the spot, in the recording session, which is a rare occurence but not impossible. The good news is i just found the (ref: i-like-p2.jpg\"target=\"_blank\">written update which contains the last line written at the end. and i can say for certain that you are supposed to cross out the entire line before \"v2\" and also cross out everything up until that new line. the only reason i probably didn't cross it out is because i knew i was already recording it so i didn't need to make note of that change. but i can assure you that i never intended for that additional 4 bars to be in addition to the other 27. they are intended to replace everything from \"get it\" and after. so with some assembly required, you can take the original page 1 from <a href=\"https://billwurtz.com/i%20like.pdf\"target=\"_blank\">here, then cross out the last 27 bars and REPLACE it with the last 4 bars of <a href=\"i-like-p2.jpg\"target=)_blank)this page. and the extra 27 bars remains as a bonus alternate ending, which should NOT include the final 4"

But when i shorten up the attack and release, then that very quickly turns it into something that is delightful for me to play, as a keyboard player. Another thing you can do is program in something on one of the wheel controls. my 2 favorite options for this are filter cutoff (wawawawaw), and vibrato. To do a nice vibrato the way i like, set the LFO to somewhere around 4x per second, then make the LFO control the pitch up and down, then, set the wheel to increase the depth of the LFO as you push the wheel up. If you have things on the wheels then i think you're gonna have a lot of fun and be able to express yourself really well"

But if you're wondering how to get this to happen while you are actually equipped with writing tools, my suggestion for that is just gradually start using the writing tools more and more, without worrying about whether anything is 'good' yet. then one day, when you least expect it, the unpredictable flow of meaning will continue as it always does, except the tools will already be comfortable in your hands"

(this is what happened to me in the early stages). what i would suggest is to make sure there is no make up gain, then make sure the ratio is not 1:1 (make sure the first number is higher), then raise the threshold all the way up. Now it should be doing exactly nothing. then press the bypass button on and off to compare, and it should sound exactly the same. Also check to see if there is a 'reduction' monitor so you can see when it's actually doing something. So now it should be doing nothing. Now, with the bypass off (so the compressor is ON), start gradually lowering the threshold until you start to see the 'reduction' meter gradually start to light up when it hits those loud parts, and it should be tapering them down. then once you've compressed it down a little then you can raise the make up gain"

Now I'm kind of back to trying to puzzle piece lyrics into the preexisting verse melody. I've tried to come up with a new melody/lyrics but then it seems too unrelated to the beginning.

Also the time when you're gonna get the right answer is gonna be after you've heard the whole thing through from the beginning up to the stopping point, in real time. what i would recommend is, record a run-through of what you have, then play some sort of calming sound-free game whilst listening to the recording. and don't be alarmed if you don't seem to get ANYTHING. you'll just have to wait a little longer until your brain actually calms down and until you actually are not thinking about it. then, plentiful answers will flow like water. then the race is on to catch them all in time"

So when it's time to record/produce and song/video, i have an elaborate writing/selection process where i write some brand new things first, add them to the list, then go through the entire list, pick out good candidates for the next production (i usually end up choosing about 25), then i do some additional writing on some of those, then finally i make my final selection. Then i continue writing that one to completion. The idea of casually finding a song, and just thinking 'oh this is good so i'll do it' seems hilarious to me. that's just not how it works. my mind has to go to full scale war with itself to settle on a song selection"

I the jingle i made was \"hello, i'm a piece of garbage\" (not the one you are referring to), which seemed appropriate. Then, maybe a couple of selections later, just by chance, i got one from the next day immediately after that (also in the summer of 2007). And it had exactly the same sort of affliction.
