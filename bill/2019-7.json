Ive been trying to figure out what short form of what I was trying to do back then would sound like because I thought I wanted to try something new on my revisiting of music, but hearing those old tracks make me want to try harder this time, and starting small.

Take the song 'happy birthday to you' in the key of C. right before the end of the song, on the last \"birth\". the harmony is probably playing C chord, but i think you'll find that the best place for the bass, at this point in the song, is G. i can name a trillion other examples of popular/classic/traditional songs, over the course of the last 300 years, that have had a 1(chord) over 5(bass) absolutely thrive in this right before the end finalistic 'the song's about to end' spot. you've heard it a million times. try putting C over C there instead .... it doesn't quite fit. it sounds like the beginning of the song, .... right before the end ? ... By the way, to complete the example just you you can hear it clearly, the 'good' way to do it, from the final line \"birth\" is C/G, \"day\" is D7, \"to\" is G7sus4, and \"you\" is C, preferably with the G note left out, just e c , with low C in the bass. and Fmin/Ab was on \"hap\""

            "these are 2 extremely different activities. it makes sense that you would feel lost trying to do a solo singer/songwriter 1 instrument+voc song as a full arrangement, and similarly it makes sense that it might feel impossible to take a full arrangement and perform it live with 1 inst+voc. they are completely different machines. the translation can  be made, but it might take a lot of experience to figure out how the heck it's gonna work. actually what i was explaining before is that they are such different things that i wouldn't recommend trying to get one to work like the other. you might just feel confused and frustrated. in other words, i would say don't try to play the same kind of guitar track. probably don't even use the guitar, or if you use guitar don't use the same one and don't play it in the same way, and definitely don't do that first. i was recommending doing the percussion first. that's just something i've learned from experience. not the drums, not the bass, not the chords, but actually the percussion. like shakers/tambs/hi hats, etc. ch-k-ch-k-ch that sort of thing. this is why you'll need to have your writing all zipped up at this point, tempo and roadmap need to be finalized in order for this approach to really work. if you're curious as to how to learn how to run such a complex operation, i would suggest starting with songs less than 5 seconds in length"

However, one time i saw F11 in a book and they actually used it to represent Eb/F (which means Eb, G, Bb, with F in the bass.) in other words, F9sus4. I'm pretty sure if you write F11, it will be not clear whether it includes the A or not. I'm not sure if F11 is assumed to be shorthand for F7sus4. I don't think it's clear enough. If you actually want the A and the Bb, and the Eb, i would recommend saying F7add4. if you don't want the A, i would recommend saying F7sus4. F11 will be ambiguous on the question of whether to include the A, which is kind of an important question"

(actually when doing it all in numbers like this i prefer to write the 6 higher than the 5, but that's not always so easy in text, especially plaintext like this, so i don't blame you). another thing, when you have the 1aug, i think it's most likely 1aug7. they're not doing us a favor with the release/cutoff of these chords being so long, the chords are bleeding into each other. Makes that flat5 thing much less effective than it could be, and difficult to identify because if we try to pause and isolate that moment by brute force, it's going to have the previous chord smeared in with it. But for sure plain as day to me that feels like a thing i always use, which would be a 3aug triad over b5 bass note. (not b5dim as you called it) so in this key, Baug/C#. if you listen carefully you can very clearly hear the E note (from the C/D chord)   change to Eb during the chord. also, for more even smaller nitpicks, the 2min on the second line is 2min7. just noticed the first chord at the very top also has a 2 in it. so you might say 1sus2,4. and the 1maj9 on the first line i would definitely call that 5/1 (5 over 1). straight off the yacht"

Then, when it goes \"help me if you can i'm feeling down\" this is essentually 2 parallel universes running side by side. according to what came before, this sounds like the 2 min chord. so the G will now sound like an interesting flat7. but by the time we hit the E7, all of a sudden you can re-map the entire last 4 bars (two chords worth) as if they have been in Bmin (D) the whole time. similarly showing up at that A7 hang about to put you to bed in D, which again it does not, it just stays in A. just does. to have the fun of going around and doing it all again"

I've been trying to find my personality type for months now, and I still haven't quite found it yet. I've been doing research on cognitive functions, I've been looking through different MBTI-related subreddits, I've taken millions of different personality tests and it's driving me insane because I get different results every darn time!! I really have this need/desire to fit in one of the 16 personality types, but I just can't seem to truly relate to any of them (for example, I'm too dumb to be an INTP, not sporty/active enough to be an ISTP, way too lazy to be an ISTJ etc.)... Maybe I'm not meant to have a personality after all? Maybe there's a secret 17th personality type that I do not know of?\nDo these 16 personality types even matter? I have zero idea at this point.\nDo you have any advice on getting over this 16-personalities-thing?",

The video made me realise that I should definitely learn more about music stuff, so I decided to download a free demo version of some random music theory book today. The book thing introduced me to basic music notation stuff first. I was doing fine and having fun until I came across tuplets/grouplets. I just straight up had a short crying session because the darn thing blew my mind (in a negative way). Like, how are you supposed to divide a whole note into three half notes???",

            "I just wanted to have fun!! I've even watched some videos regarding this topic, but I'm still not quite sure if I get the hang of it. I did try to make my own definition, but I think I might need your help with improving it. It basically goes like this: \"a tuplet/grouplet is a group o f multip le shorter notes used as a substitute for a single longer note (for example a group of 3 eighth notes can be used instead of a single quarter note)\" . Does my definition make any sense? How would you explain tuplets in your own words? What's the most important thing to know about tuplets? Also, where can I find really good examples of tuplets in songs? Thank you a lot in advance!!!",
            "a good way to start is with the most common case: 8th note triplets. 3 of those will fit in the time of 1 quarter note. you distinguish this by putting the number 3 above them like (ref: trip1.png\">this (sorry for messy, new computer, no new pen yet. old pen does not work. need a new pen) that's the way it's normally written, but, to be more precise, it's actually 3:2. (3 in the time of 2.) but because that's so common, people just write 3. You can do this with any note value. another common way to see it is like (ref: 16trip.png\">this. that's 2 16th note triplets and 2 regular 16th notes. the 2 16th note triplets are occuring at a 3:2 rate which means there's 3 in the time you'd normally have 2. Sometimes you might see a group of 5 16th notes under a number 5, like <a href=\"5tup.png\">this. this doesn't happen too often, but i think you can generally assume that the 5 means 5:4, and those 5 quintuplets are taking the space of 4 16th notes. but you can know for sure by looking at the rest of the bar and seeing how much space they take up. Usually the only time you'll see the : symbol being used is when it's a strange/uncommon situation and you need to clarify the ratio. actually the most common place i think you'd see it is if you are in a 6/8 time signature, which kind of makes normal 8th notes behave like triplets, because there are 3 per beat, with no number 3 written. So if you want to put 4 notes per beat instead, you'd have to say 4:3 to say 4 in the time of 3. like <a href=)4inthetimeof3.png)this. this is exhausting. need a new pen"
