I also have this app on my phone that's like a metronome but you can plug in the specific rhythm notation, so I've been doing that to check to make sure my timing is good. Couple more questions about this whole thing. Are triplets almost always going going to be grouped in 3's?Maybe its not really common cause I'm not seeing it in any of my sheet music, but would you ever see something like one eighth note/rest triplet just by itself immediately followed by a 'regular', non-triplet note/rest?",
            "heads would explode, that would simply not be readable by any normal human",
            "And will triplets almost always start right at the top of the beat, like would you ever see 3 quarter note triplets, but starting on the \"and\" of the beat? How would you count out stuff where you kind of have to subdivide a single beat into 3's as well as into 2's or 4 's for regular eighth or sixteenth notes? (sorry if this is all jumbled, I hope you understand what I mean though).",
            "something to that effect could happen, on a larger scale, for example you could have quarter note triplets starting on beat 2 or 4. but effectively what that would be is 8th note triplets hitting every other one. for example, take the percussion/hi-hat accents in that song 'everybody wants to rule the world' that's doing this. it would be not practical to write it as quarter note triplets, you would want to write that as 8th note triplets alternated with 8th note rests, starting with a rest, and lining up with the downbeats on 2 and 4"

But I get thrown off whenever triplets (or some kind of tuplet) comes in to play. I can clap out quarter note triplets or eighth note triplets over a click, but when it comes in the middle of a measure, or on an offbeat, or if there's only just one or two (instead of 3) of the triplets or if you have the triplets tied together with other notes, or a quarter note triplet paired with an eighth note triplet... all that kind of stuff just throws me off. I guess I kind of internalized the triplets in groups of 3 (three 8th note or 3 quarter note triplets in a line starting on the downbeat) and when they don't fall like that, I just can't feel the rhythm. Do you have any tips for how to count this stuff, or better yet just like how to internalize the feel of the notes to make them c ome more  easy and natural? Ideally, I just want to get to the point where I can just feel it and play it naturally and don't have to be counting continuously in my head when trying to read. Just like when playing for fun, or making my own music I'm feeling the pulses of the bar, but I'm not counting all the subdivisions just letting the rhythms come naturally. I feel like I'm probably using all these tuplets a lot in my own playing and not even realizing when I'm doing it.",

            "Hey bill. I am kind of a dreamer and I don't quite understand how I developed the mindset I did, being surrounded by so many people who think differently than me, but I'm really happy I did. I just believe more that everybody's special and should do what they want to do in life, regardless of their status and that they have the power to achieve that. But each time I bring this up, my whole family tries so hard to bash into my head that this is the wrong way to approach the world and it really upsets me because I believe that my approach to the world is how one can achieve creation and innovation. Like if we had accepted how things were and never strive to change, us as a human race wouldn't be where we are now. And it saddens me when people around me try soooo hard to force me to think like what they do- don't stand out and accept things the way they are and so much bullshit in my opinion. I look up to a lot of people that inspire me, like you, and s o many o thers, and all the great things that surround me in my life that give me hope that I could push foreword and prove everybody around me wrong. That I can live the life I want, and that I could potentially make it and be like you or my other inspirations and bring more great things to the rest of the world. It's my main motivation in my life at the moment. But it's really hard with so many people surrounding me like this- telling me I shouldn't think this way. I don't agree with settling any less and living someone else's life and wasting what makes me unique and great. It's just difficult to find the time to put my energy into what I want to do with the many responsibilities I have already and With all of these people trying so hard to change me. I know my situation may not seem that bad, but It's kinda driving me crazy. Stressing me out. Sometimes my hope dwindles because of this. I want to breakthrough and prove all of these people wrong, but it's always inevitable that my energy a lways crashes and my hope fades and I fall apart. My question is how do you push through when it seems that the world around you is so against you? What advice do you think would help me Persist?",

When I plug a whole note into my software it doesn't let me add any other notes because I think the software thinks that I want to add the notes after 4 beats of the whole note and not while it's ringing out, but maybe I'm writing it wrong. How would you write that out (by hand)?",

But it's weird writing for instruments you don't play, because I don't know if these parts are playable. I try to stay in their range but there's a whole lot i don't know about the mechanics of these instruments. Like i don't know how long of a phrase a horn/wind player can realistically play without needing space for breathing in between notes/phrases. How fast certain instruments can play or how long they can hold out notes, can this instrument slide up/down to notes and play in between pitches or is it set pitches, stuff like that. I'm worried that I'll spend all this time writing and finally meet musicians to play these parts and they'll be like \"dude, that's not possible t o play o n this instrument\".

Thanks! But, wouldn't thinking in terms of modes mostly come in handy when you have a song where the harmony is just kind of vamping on 1 chord for a long time (or maybe multiple chords, but that change slowly.. as in, one chord every few bars or whatever)?",
            "yes, i would say so. a famous example is \"so what\" by miles davis. (dorian). another example would be \"the way you make me feel\" by michael jackson which i just realized is a bar by bar chord rip of \"on broadway\" (mixolydian) or at least before they go to the 4 chord it just vamps on mixolydian. dorian and mixolydian are really the main ones that you are going to find useful in \"music.\" lydian, like i said, comes in handy if you want to create the childlike wonder found in the opening of a 1990s steven spielberg movie, and \"ionian\" and \"aeolian\" are just another name for regular major and regular minor. the other remaining 'strange' ones are not so useful because if u are gonna be strange you are better off being strange on your own without restriction",
            "I guess it's really important to establish what the root is. Like C lydian is technically G major, so if you want it sound lydian and not like G major, you really gotta focus in on C and F# in the melody and hammer it in that you're not in plain old G major.",
            "just play and see what works",
            "I guess thinking in terms of modes is mostly useful when you're really going for that specific quality/sound the modes have?",
            "i think the point of modes is so we have an easy name for that time when you want a minor scale but u want to keep the natural 6. (dorian). or that time when u want a major scale but you want the flat 7 (mixo). that's the main way modes are used, in the business. and no one ever says 'modes' really, you would just say \"major\", \"minor\", \"dorian\", or \"mixo.\" as far as the sequence of 7 'modes', that's just a red herring, to throw young music students off the trail and confuse them and get them to think they don't understand music when in reality music is as easy to understand as tender lovemaking",
            "The way I was taught it (way back when I was taking lessons still) was to use modes when 'soloing over chord changes'. Like, if you have (to chose a boring, textbook example) a I-vi-ii-V in C, that you think ionian over the I, aeloian over the vi, dorain over the ii and mixolydian over the V. But that was never helpful to me to think in those terms.",
            "ew, that's terrible advice, when playing over 1,6,2,5 sequence in C, just play in C! more specifically just get used to playing over 1,6,2,5 in C. and like maybe learn how to hit the F note when it lands on the d minor, but your ears (if you have them) should easily point you there. if you are thinking about an entire 'scale' for each chord individually you are going to have a very bad time and the listener will too"
