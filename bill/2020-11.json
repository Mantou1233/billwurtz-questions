At the time of selection, the song was only written up to the end of the first chorus. So i was feeling a deep amount of regret, the day after selecting it. but changing it would increase all doubts all around, because it had been a very thorough selection process, and if i invalidated that it would cast even larger shadows of doubt on the entire ability to select a song. So i was sitting in the waiting chairs for a haircut, just being very unsure of how to carry forward with the song, ... i had already attempted to change my mind earlier in the morning, to a much slower and sadder song. and i found myself circling back again to 'la de da', and just at the exact moment i was getting into the haircut chair, i let my mind turn to what i think might happen next, in the writing. obviously we are going into the second verse. And it's moments like these, when we say 'what if', that suddenly a blitz of writing comes. The first 3 lines of the second verse came at me very quickly. the relentlessness of the word 'mall' had a nice momentum to it, and certainly helped to plunge me into confidence that the song was the right choice, and by the time i got into the chair, i was certain i would be doing that song. the 4th line, however, did not come at all, and i had to force it later in the actual writing session and i am to this day not proud of it. so if i could summerize the answer to your original question, the meaning of the triple mall is 'momentum'"

            "at any time, anywhere, ideas can fall on me. even in dreams. that is one part of the process. learning to catch these is crucial to this part of the process. about 70% of the strongest ideas come unexpectedly, not during a songwriting session. So they must be captured and cataloged properly. At that time usually no work is done beyond the capture of the idea. Alternatively, to generate ideas, a more deliberate idea generation session can occur. this is planned, when you try to come up with ideas. remembering a key principle which is that songs can come from literally anywhere, there may be various clever strategies about which places to look. the fun part is, because they can come from anywhere, there is no limit to the places you can look. But still, this is just idea generation, separate from the remainder of the songwriting work. it's still just an idea generation session. Then there is the 'work', which is when you tend to entries in the catalog. depending on the situation, you may be tasked to finish an entire item, or just part of it, before moving onto another. But in either case, you are essentially playing hospital with the song. diagnose it, figure out what it is, what it wants to be, what it's meant to be, etc, and make decisions accordingly. 95% of the time i work strictly forwards, only being concerned with what comes next, and continuing along in order, forwards. The only situation where i would be forced to work backwards is if the original idea does not belong at the beginning. then it's a puzzle to fill in what came before, which seems to defy all laws of physics for me. very unusual. but it can be done and there are various tricks which work with varying degrees of effectiveness. So the majority of the songwriting process (basically all of it except the initial idea seed) follows the same idea of figuring out what comes next. so there are a few important practices that always seem to hold true. agree on an exact tempo as soon as you can, and run a metronome to keep from drifting. this avoids a crisis where you've drifted the tempo and now you may be writing at a level of density which is never gonna fit at the same tempo as what you've already written elsewhere in the song. another important concept is the fact that you really only know what's best the FIRST time you hear it. so you have to do whatever you can to protect this authentic, real time run through, from the mindset of never having heard it before. of course, when you're working, you're inevitably gonna hear it many times. a standard trick i use to help 're-set' is to walk to the door and touch the door handle (with the metronome running) and return and run-through from the beginning. it's also important to remember, full run-throughs are much much more valuable than only running the last part. the full-run through is the only thing that's going to truly reveal where we are at, at a certain point in the song, and thus to properly determine what happens (or does not happen) next. Another thing to realize, if nothing seems to be working and you keep trying things and ditching them, it's important to recognize that the ideas get worse the more you reject them. so if you reject 3 ideas, the 4th will be worse. so if you get too deep into a hole of rejecting, it can be useful to recognize that the first one might be the best one you're gonna get, and make extra effort to try to make the first one work, because in that case it's usually your best shot. Finally, another interesting trick which i've been using a lot recently is, pretend it's in a video. pretend it's taking place in a movie, inside a story. This doesn't even mean you're gonna write a video, but sometimes just pretending it's taking place in a video, will immediately cause interesting songwriting to materialize effortlessly. it's bizarre, because many times when this technique is working, it's not even associated with any particular video content. it's just because you told yourself to pretend you are thinking of visual content, this somehow creates an automatic trigger for songwriting"

So i had spent an entire day songwriting and i pretty much only made it through 2 stanzas. so the next day i had to kick myself and realize that this schedule is so ridiculous that i need to finish the song in the next 4 hours or it's pretty much game over. the 'sign' bit is the first bit to be written under that assumption. so in a way you can probably assume that this is the feeling of realizing i am going to have to steamroll the entire remainder of the songwriting process for this song. And i should clarify, steamrolling sometimes leads to fantastic growth, and i am thrilled with where the song ends up going, especially toward the end. and i don't think it would have ever gone like that, had the prior steamrolling not occured. it's a lesson that continues to play out again and again in the creative process, in the context of a world with limited time and resources"

For the older one, he came to class knowing jingle bells. he likes learning songs. i am thinking of teaching him some chords to play along with jingle bells. but i also am teaching him a bit about the circle of fifths, how it relates to sharps and flats in different keys, and then showing him how jingle bells can be played starting in any note. I am very slowly trying to teach them how to read notes off a pentagram but I feel like that can dampen the excitement for the instrument if it becoems too \"academized\". I took a look at a teaching book and it doesnt look too fun tbh. maybe the best time to teach them to r ead musi c is when they want to learn a specific song? I can notate it for them and have them read off it? They range ages 4 to 10 probably. Some are more motivated than others but i feel they can all get excited about different aspects of piano/music/learning",

However, what you may not hear, but is still said, is similar but reversed comments about the morning. But with a different twist, because it goes in the opposite direction of the way it's been heading. so, for example, in the springtime in the morning, after it changes, people in the early morning will be saying 'well, the mornings have been gradually getting lighter these past few weeks, but they just suddenly got darker again, although i know they are still going to gradually get ligher from here.' and in the fall, in the morning, just after it changes back, people in the early morning will say 'well, the mornings have been getting gradually darker over the past few weeks, but suddenly they just got brighter again, although i know they still will continue to get darker from here.'"

Then, they provide an alternate situation, 'objectively', which means there is only one right answer and you are not allowed to disagree with that. It's sort of like a good cop / bad cop scenario, where the 'subjectivity' scenario gives you a false sense of comfort, thinking it's ok for people to have different opinions, then the hammer comes down when 'objectively' there is only one true opinion, which spells checkmate for the other person of course"
