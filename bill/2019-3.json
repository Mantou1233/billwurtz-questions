            "i've always been extremely proficient in reading rhythmic notation, because drums was my main instrument for most of my childhood. but i never really spent any time on reading pitched notation. i've played with many small jazz groups where they play standards off a lead sheet, maybe even sight reading it, and it sounds like a tune, just right off the page. i began to be really jealous of this, and i figured i was probably almost there. because i had already been using notation to write my own songs in the library, writing easily pretty much as fast as i could move the pencil. so i knew i was pretty close to having it altogether where i could sight read a lead sheet melody, but i felt like i never really put in the solid time to practice. so i started doing tunes out of a realbook, almost like pretending i was a small jazz ensemble, doing tunes i had never heard before. recording the tracks 1 part at a time, usually just drums, bass, chord, and lead. often i would take the tempo quite slow. i think i started with 'central park west' and then moved on from there. then fast forward about a year, i was scrambling through different possibilities of making videos, audio/visual content, etc, and thinking about preparing to get 'online', .... and some very simple experimental ideas came up, such as taking one of those jazz recordings and putting some kind of video on it. the jazz starbucks video would be an example of that. also there is one for the song 'tune up' where the video simply scrolls through the apps on my dock. i didn't do too many more videos like that, because, well, they're stupid"

(that's well on target, that's essentially the fastest is 1 day. even some of the 2-week projects had their song written in 3 days.). Still weirdly praying that i might be on time for 1 week sched. truthfully the instruments organizing set me back a day. that's not a normal occurance, it was a serious quantity of new instruments. a lot to search through. Anyway, very quick temp insts (for vocs to sing over) and then immediately all vocals, lead and backup, the entire day Sat 2/16. this is the standard quickest time, before the 2 week schedule it would be many days. Ok, so what happens next (had to check the records here) this is what happened, going into sunday. This already would have been the most insanely tight sched, to be able to finish an entire music video by the following tuesday (?????), but the way it happened, i had been up very late songwriting, leading into Friday morning (when i did vocals) and i needed to wake up quite early on Friday to get vocals (the entire day time is just barely enough to get all vocals for 1 song, especially with mostly full harmonies for the majority of the song). So the plan was was to go straight to sleep at the end of that vocal day, and i would need it, because of so little sleep just before the vocal day. I actually got into bed and litterally could not fall asleep. was lying there for about 6 hours. this is unusual, usually i don't even bother getting into bed if i'm not tired, but this time it was not only essential for the schedule, but also it should have worked! i was on barely any sleep from the night before, so i thought it had to work. but, i essentially got my ass kicked for the 20th time by circadia. basically that means, (and i think i've finally learned my lesson now) Even if you slept way way too little the night before, and are lacking on sleep, you STILL might not be able to fall asleep until pretty much the same time you went to bed previously. If i had known this retrospectively, i would have simply jumped right into the music (instrumental) arrangement, which CAN happen at night. i just didn't expect that to be the right move, because of the lack of sleep from before the vocal. So you might look at it and say that moment was what the initial failure of a potential 1-week delivery hinged upon. So once i actually fell asleep around 6am, i was gone, for more than a full night's (day's) sleep. That was the point the 1-week was completely gone, but that's not really fair to say that because the 1-week is so freakin tight squeeze that that surely wasn't the 'only' thing that would have gone wrong. as it is, the 1-week relies on essentially doubling my best time (cutting the time in half) of every phase of the project. (do everything at least twice as fast as my absolute fastest time). So anyway, that Sunday (actually more like the overnight into monday morning) is a significant moment of loss, because tuesday was lost. What typically happens when you reach this point is, the exhaustion from the previous days tends to hit, because the endorphins from the excitement about that date (Tues 2/19 in this case) are lost, so there is kind of a forced rest (exhaustion). Seems i spent the whole day (which at this point is mostly the overnight going into Monday morning) working on reality edits. not such a bad deal, that's a project that is chronically behind and has been forever. the following day, (Tues, on the early side), it seems i was looking to develop other projects that constantly get left behind, one of which was a the idea of doing a basic recorded music arrangement and sing/play keyboard with it live. not to actually perform publicly with, but to work the arrangements out, and then hopefully result in a smooth hand off to a real band arrangement somewhere down the line. Tried it on some cover songs, but quickly got 'uselessitis', which always inevitably tends to happen when you are 'experimenting' on something without actually knowing specifically what the project is and when/how it's due. This jolt typically sends me back to the linear schedule, with a new set of ambitious dates to go for, because the conclusion is always that when left alone to freefloat, every project evaporates badly. So i think that's generally the idea here, and it is likely i spent way too long on questions that day. Also during this day i was deeply studying my own procedures, particularly during the 2-week song schedule, to really study the time it took for each bit, desperately searching for somewhere to shave additional time off somewhere. the general conclusion i had been operating with was that 'arrangement AND mix' (that's the entire instrumental arrangent AND the final mix) needed to be done in 1 day in order for me to even have a shred of time for the video. like the whole schedule was mapped out as tightly as possible, and it all seemed to hinge upon 1 of 3 impossibles being true: \"day 0\" doesn't exist, \"arr+mix\" in 1 day and not even a 24 hour day (must be 12 only), or, entire visual video done in \"the monday slam\" which is where the entire visual is made between approximately 10am monday and 4pm tuesday, without sleeping. (this was pretty much accomplished only once, and it is not a pretty sight. in fact mostly on the 2 week schedule, this final slam is mandatory, but only once was the entire visual started on monday morning, and that was only a 2 minute song. in another case i did the final 3 minutes on the monday morning slam). the monday morning slam is not pretty, and any reasonable health professional would certainly advise me never to do that again. So i basically had the 1 week schedule hinging upon either A) no day 'zero', B) arr+mix in 1 day, or C)'monday slam required.' Just to fill you in on these other options briefly, 'day zero' consists of: write and schedule all tweets for 7 days, get anagrams done for 7 days, MAKE A REALITY VID (thanks to new release schedule which i don't intend on breaking) and 'generalized songwriting' (new ideas, development on ideas, before selecting next proj, in order to strengthen what we have to select from of course, without songgen the list would eventually be empty)... and god forbid, 'chill.' Those are all things that go into 'day zero.' So again, if day zero is allowed, and if you want 2 actual days for visual, and if you write the entire song in 1 day, and do all the vocals in 1 day, (these are generally assumed maxed out in terms of the best i can do), then that allows only ONE DAY for the ENTIRE arr+mix. What i'm trying to say is, the absolute best i've ever done on arr+mix is total something like 3 days. Anyway, that is what i was studying on Tue 2/19, was arr+mix total times, during the 2 week schedule, trying to figure out if i had ever been anywhere close to 12 hours. Because that was essentially the concession that would need to be made. And i think my conclusion was that it's highly unlikely but it's worth a shot. So then,  it appears  Wed 2/20 is now day zero, looks like i wrote all the tweets. Tweet writing can be a monster, if you wanna get a week's worth, it can really take a while to get it, especially after thousands of tweets and refusing to actually repeat tweets. Ok, so Thu 2/21 looks like we're moving full ahead on the inst arrangement. keep in mind, the only way to have a chance at the magic '1 week' thing is if i can suddenly do the arr. AND mix, to completion, in less than 1 normal length day. ridiculous. even on the most insane crunches during the 2 week (slow down, st helens, most of them actually) it was like, if i power through mercilessly for a long day, i can maybe get it to mostly near the end on a 1st round arrangement, and then the second day i'll pick where i left off, then back to the beginning second round arr. / adjust, fix/improve, (called \"arr2\") which takes much less time than arr 1, and then if i push into 24 hour marathon for that day i can arrive at the final mix. that's the absolute best i've ever done for \"arr+mix\", like something like 3 days pretty much. So yea, am i magically get that all to fit in 12 hours? no. Using almost entirely brand new instruments is not quite speeding things up, feeds the obsessive meticulousness. After 3 days the arr. is finally done. Not entirely sure what the sleep schedule looks like around this point, a quote from Sun 2/24 4:26 am, is \"getting angry and desperate\", still all i can think about is the 1-week, and yet 2-weeks is suddenly blown, because you can't be not done with the mix on Sunday. my absolute world record for this may have had the mix finished as late as sunday morning. and then an ultra slammer from monday morning straight through (not healthy, nor possible). Somewhere around this time, got hooked on Alex Honnold climbing videos, and general wisdom from Alex Honnold, the main thing i took from that can be summarized in a clip i posted here yesterday, so at least that had some value. Essentially focusing that on the 1-week schedule. Unfortunately 2-weeks is now blown, as i said, which can happen if you focus too intently on the 1. this is my life these days. But anyway, the final mix, it appears, was reached Sun 2/24 at 2:22 am. (minus car test, no car test, and i don't really care that much because it sounds great on the leading brand of earbuds, which is my main reference anyway.) So racing forward of course, Mon 2/25 is recording all video footage (gonna be a live action vid, for sure). Getting everything for voc, and every instrument. With this one i really thoroughly went throuh the whole thing getting everything i need for all instruments. then clip selecting (going through all of it), then import and full sync of all vocal bits and significant inst fills, assembled into full rough cut which appears to be completed tue 2/26 6:31pm. So this is crossing the 2 week point, so a lot of confidence will inevitably be lost at this point. because, a little history, my best time for these projects was 8 weeks, absolutely couldn't do better than that, for a long time, until i entered panic mode in sept 2018 and suddenly did them in 2 weeks each, that was psycho mode. And it was going steadily until i started wanting to add more, and it has failed ever since, as a result of obsessively aiming for 1 week. So when we cross over 2 weeks, it becomes a little 'what the hell is going on.' The other important element here is that there is a guest appearance on a Scary Pockets session video, scheduled in L.A. on sunday 3/3, and i've scheduled a week long trip to visit family, on another continent entirely, immediately after that. I think my plan at the point of 2/26 was to finish the music video AND fit in another very short video before leaving, also. But looking at the records, i'm embarassed to say not much was accomplished for the next few days. To be fair and humane, i suppose i should admit that when you spend long hours constantly working every single day, there reaches a point where you just can't lift a finger for a few days. it seems i was watching a lot of quentin tarantino interviews during these few days (i've never seen his movies, just the interviews). Very uncomfortable several days, i recall really feeling like i couldn't figure out how to get it together. still just wishing for that 1 week schedule, and still feeling like it's so far out of reach. To actually let the music video go unfinished before leaving the country seemed completely unthinkable, but at the same time i was feeling completely torn and shredded from constantly failing this 1 week thing (AND 2 week, it's been a similar stagger of repeated failures ever since early december). So, one way or another, i decided it was actually better to do the unthinkable, and let it slide, get out of town, and then have a better chance at a fresh start and hitting that fresh 1 week ambition 1 more time from the start. because i've been trying to get this 1 week thing since december and just can't seem to let go of it. So the trip was good, gave me a chance to figure some things out (maybe ... or is it just the same thing as always? wish i could do the impossible, think i still can, really excited to try again, oblivious to past failures). Somewhere on about mar 7, on an epic 4 hour walk from somewhere from East Croydon, i got the typical maximum jolt of excitement and determination to absolutely get the 1 week schedule, starting from my return Sat 3/8, finishing current video for immediate tuesday, and then absolutely jump to 1 week from there. Finished entire 'day zero' (just tweets and ans really, for this time) on the plane (cept for reality video, which i already had ready from weeks ago) and was more ready than ever. From then, upon returning home, i did very well. Completely full days of work, maxed out hustling, all devices set to airplane mode, etc. Still required monday push (awake from mid-monday all the way until tuesday evening). Essentially was half way through first round of graphics on monday afternoon, and just started crashing, very early on in that day. Not just because of the 'time crunch,' but really i was just suddenly so insanely sick of all my existing video techniques, and just being really worn down from the quality sacrifices i had had to make with speed-production in general, ever since the 2 week schedule. hit a very low point, really felt unable to find new exciting ways of doing things. but actually because of that low, i was able to pull through within a couple of hours and have some very deep breakthroughs, with regard to technique, ideas, etc. Actually revitalizing most of my strong points in video making, etc. Really had some great breakthroughs, ... made it to the end by about 6am, rendered up and turned back around to beginning, still needing a hefty second round, because part of the breakthrough was not attempting so much to try to get it all there in 1 round, because in order to achieve graphic density you have to first work entirely devoid of graphic density, to free up your mind to get more precise with the motions, which i discerned was something that's probably been lacking for the past i dunno year of videos for me (and that's a strong point so it's important to reclaim that) ... anyway, did very well in the first verse (second round), got it all set, and then just looked at that 'somewhere else instead' screen, which at the time was much more plain than it is now, looked at the time, it was like maybe 11am, and realizing there are still huge chunks of this video that are just pure blandness ..... already having been well beyond delerium over the course of the night (was awake for about 24 hours at this point) and sadly, despite a quite awesome push during the previous 3 days, had to give up. It was just too high a risk that it would have been total crap AND nearly destroyed myself physically (similar to the final push on many of the 2-week projects last fall.) The good news in this case, was i felt i had already had the more significant crisis-breakthrough the previous afternoon (Monday). so whatever. peaceful failure. Yet still again, plunged into mystery as to what the 'plan' is. And of course a bit of exhaustion from past 4 days of constant push. tweet writing needs to be done, pretty much wed 3/13 is tweet writing. Again, as usual, taking this time to regroup and also intensely study the 1-week plan, searching in different ways for possible ways to reconstruct it and shave off time. this time i've learned my lesson about arr+mix in 12 hours being out of the question, so instead i'm looking at condensing known 1-day entities, where the best time has been 1 day, yet i've achieved that repeatably, and looking to condense those to half a day. with that, it can become more like arr+mix has 2 days, and vid actually may have 3. so those are the kinds of things that are in the latest compromise. (keep in mind, the 1-week idea is still wildly on mars, but i never stop going for it. i just can't stop fixating on it). Spent too much time on questions for sure, wednesday into thursday, and then strange timing because suddenly a magazine interview i did is in the draft stage and i'm supposed to approve it (thank goodness i have final approval) .... it actually needed quite a bit of fixing, and material needed to be added, so i had to go digging through the questions archives, and perfectionism kicked in, so i spent quite a bit of time searching for better material for that, and the time was tight on that because it was supposed to be sent to print within a day or so after that. had to be awake for a strange time for extra phone call with magazine editor due to strange timezone difference, then actually that same day i had an appointment for car maintanence in an unusual location. so the whole thing strung together into a long day of not work, which to be honest is what i needed at that point. Friday 3/15 am fully back at it, pushing round 2 of graphics, and not particularly being in the mood to have this thing suck, because i'm tired of sucking and we've already been in this one for 4+weeks at this point. Tried my best to get it done 'several days before tues 3/19' because the idea is that we're gonna still go for 1 week on the next one, and it is so outrageous that i probably need a head start in order to have any flying chance. But essentially, for Sat, and Sun, i basically simply maxed out after a 12 hour work day. Would have been nice to make a real 'last minute push' and just zip it up for Saturday or something, but i was just simply topping out after 12 hours each day. like, can't do it anymore, let me go, do questions, sleep, whatever. And to be fair, any reasonable doctor would say you just can't make it a regular habbit to slam yourself silly. So, unfortunately, it was ordinary length work days (like 8 to 12 hours) at a relatively average pace, and it didn't get done until monday, ... actually as of waking up around 3pm monday it still wasn't done and i had actually thought i had resigned myself for tuesday. But somewhere around 3:30 pm i just told myself to 'shut, the, fuck, up' and stop worrying about details and just get the damn thing for release on monday, and whipped together the final corrections within an hour or so and got it set for monday. Might actually fit better with the first verse line anyway. So that's how it happened. and now my 'head start' on the 1-week has been whittled down to 1 day. now the key is to not spend that entire day documenting the entire previous production period."

            "next you check for 3s. add up the digits, and if they add to a multiple of 3 then it's a multiple of 3. if the sum of the digits too high to know if it's a multiple of 3 then add those digits again and see if it's a multiple of 3. you surely already know about this so i will move on to the next part, which is the majority of the hard work. check systematically for each prime number. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, on and on and on and on. there are many tricks i have learned, but the general strategy is, you transform your target number by a multiple of 7 to deliberately make it more recognizable (smaller). and once you get it simple enough to recognize if the resulting number is a multiple of 7 or not, then you know your original number was or was not a multiple of 7. here's an example or all the techniques listed so far, just to give you the idea. i'll pick a random 4 digit number, chosen from (ref: https://www.random.org/)random.org, and it's 4588. first it's even so cut it in half. visually i can separate this into 4 58 8. (all even numbers) cut all those in half, 2 29 4. so 2294. still even. divide again, mentally do it like this: separate and then split each: 22 94. would be 11 47. (47x2 is 94, i just know that one). so 1147. now check 3. what i just did to check 3 is add 3, = 1150, drop the zero, then you can knock out '15' cuz that's a 3, and you're left with 1 which is not 3. so 3 is eliminated. 5 obviously gone too because it doesn't end in 5. now check 7. as i said before, we can transform by 7s until it's recognizable as mult of 7 or not. so actually look, i can ditch the 14 in the middle =1007 (almost like i just subtracted 140, which is obviously mult of 7 because 14 is). Ok, now i can ditch the 7. = 1000. =not a mult of 7. that's just something you should know about 1000000 or 100 or 1 or 10000000 doesn't matter how many zeros, those are made up of only 2s and 5s. ok so 7 is gone, not a part of 1147. next test, 11. easy. knock off the 11, =47. 47 clearly non11, it would have to be 44. so 11 is gone. checking 13 now. 1147, here's essentially the bread and butter technique: add 13, and that will allow you to knock off a zero. 1147+13 = 1160, drop the zero is 116. in half is 58. in half is 29. done (no 13, would have to be 26). The key to what i just did is that our 1147 number has already been divided by 2 all the way, and by 5 all the way. so this number has to be either 1 or 3 away from the nearest 10. and all the remaining primes we have to check are between 1 and 3 away from 10. so there is always an option to add or subtract from the current target number (1147 in this case) to get it to be a mult of 10, and then you can drop the zero. and if it doesn't work you can triple the prime you're testing. this is the main strategy, it's like working from the right side of the number. but there is another basic strategy too which is to go from the left. ok so 13 is gone, next is 17. clearly just subtract it, = 1130, drop zero is 113, now add 17 is 130, drop zero is 13. NOT 17. so 17 is gone. NEXT is 19. so looking at 1147, my options are either to subtract triple 19 or do something else. i happen to know triple 19 is 57, that's reasonably easy to subtract from 1147, it's 1090, or 109. prime (i already know that, the first decade of the 100s is a full prime decade, 4 primes). But let's say you didn't want to subtract 57 from 1147, too much of a headache, and honestly it kind of is. so you could actually zap 114 off the left, because 114 is a multiple of 19, if you happen to know that. then you're left with 7 which is of course non-19. Ok, next prime to check, and BY THE WAY, when doing this, if you're checking in order, the good news is you only have to go as far as the square root of the target number you're working with. so as long as i've checked every prime in order, i don't have to go any further than the square root of 1147. what is the square root of 1147? well let's see, the square root of 900 is 30, and the square root of 1600 is 40. so the square root of 1147 must be in the low 30s. so we definitely will not have to check 37 as long as we have checked all the primes up until there by the time we get there. the reason why is because if you've exhausted all previous primes, and then you find 37 goes into 1147, it's like, 37 times what?? a lower prime? impossible, because you've checked them all. so we only have to check up to 31. so the next test was 23. easy, 1147 + 23 = 1170. drop zero, 117, again easy, plus 23 is 140. drop zero, 14, that's just 7. non23. next test is 29. here's where the tricks become nifty. you can triple and it's 87, if you're in the mood to subtract 87 from 1147, but i say no thanks. i have a nice trick for 29, it's 203. (203 is a multiple of 29.) so that is very easy for this situation. 1147 + 203 is 1350. drop zero is 135. divide by 5, an easy way to divide by 5 is double it = 270 and drop the zero. 27. that is not 29. ok so next test and the only test left is 31. so you could triple it to 93, and add 1147+93 which is not so hard, but in case you are not in the mood to do that, i have a neat trick for 31 which is 403 (a multiple of 31). 1147 plus 403 is 1550, drop zero is 155, double it is 310 HOLY CRAP, A SOLUTION SHOWED ITSELF AT THE LAST MINUTE that was actually a particularly thrilling one, even though i chose it randomly. so you drop the zero and it's 31, so we've just reached 31 by transforming 1147 by multiples of 31, so we know that 1147 is a multiple of 31. and we know the partner for that has to be 37 because it has to end in 7 because of the last digit, and 47 would be too big. but let's just check, ... 111 i happen to know is 37 x 3, and then add a zero is 1110 plus 1 more 37 is 1147, so it's confirmed. So now if you want the real prime factorization of the Original number (4588) you just have to re-trace your steps for those initial divisions we did, mostly 2s if i remember ....2294, 4588. yes, that's 4x. so the complete prime factorization would be 2 x 2 x 31 x 37 = 4588. and the extra surprise is remember that ridiculously long queue you were waiting in, well surprise you're almost to the front of it, and you didn't even have to get nerd neck in the process"

            "can you please explain your schedule. everyone is referencing it but I don't know what it is",
            "making full blown audio visual content by yourself takes a frighteningly long time, especially if you want it to be relatively rich and good, and of a reasonable length. i used to do videos 5 days a week, but that was only possible with extremely short material. then i scaled back to 2 short videos a week, and then unscheduled i worked on 3 minute song-videos. to my dismay, the song-videos took a frighteningly long time. then i found success on 'vine' so it became a priority to do 7 extremely short videos per week, and there was pretty much no additional time leftover. since finding success on youtube and with longer material (longer than 6 seconds at least) i never wanted to go back to 6 seconds, because i made more than enough of that stuff to last 1000 lifetimes. but the problem is, i've been searching for a schedule that works with longer content, and i found it impossible to find one. 6 weeks seems unacceptable for one song-video. i might as well be dead. but i was already moving as fast as i thought possible. this is all i have thought about, every day, for the last 4 years or more. it's one of the defining issues of my life. some time in september 2017, i suddenly snapped and said \"2 weeks per video, that's it, just do it. 2 weeks. i don't care who you are. just do it.\" and the idea was to alternate between music video (song) and non-song video. this worked for the 1st video, soap tips (non-song) i finished that just barely inside of 2 weeks. but for the next video (song) i failed spectacularly. the fact is, it takes much much longer to make a 3 minute song+video than a 1 minute non-song video. any way you calculate it that's obviously true. especially if you are also producing a song that is supposed to be in tip-top shape. also added was the fact that i hadn't done a live action music video in about 2 years, so i was in a very very careful mindset. must have got like a trillion takes. that whole song+video took 14 weeks to make. as that one was being released, i promised myself once again that it MUST be 2 weeks per video. i resigned to not doing songs on that schedule, my plan was to do 'any' video every 2 weeks, and then 'in the background' work on song-videos. that of course is a death sentence to the song-videos, because even uninterrupted those things take massive amounts of weeks, so how would it ever get done quickly 'on the side.' so i succeeded at 2 consecutive non-songs, on a 2 week basis, then i suddenly decided it was time for another song, and i made a deadly serious promise that it would be done inside of 4 weeks. (feb 13 - mar 13) (i knew better than to ask for 2, that was just too insane.) i tried as hard as i could, and i didn't make it. once you hit an original proposed deadline and it's not done, it can be very devastating. much to my dismay, it took until april 25th to get it done, for a total of 11 weeks. during this time i should mention i felt i had very much to learn about audio mixing, and was determined to get better sounding mixes, so i was spending several days in the mix, also weeks in the arrangement, many days in vocals, and many many many days in the video. also learning new video techniques here as always. So at this point it's pretty much understood that my dreams are never going to come true with regard to the pace of music video releases. even at this stage i am frequently racing the clock, setting timers to push speed faster, and the total time for the project still remains many weeks long. the next one i completed in 8 weeks, which was a slight improvement, and the next one also in 8 weeks. then, this puts us at about September, 2018, suddenly i had another one of those panic lightning bolt moments of life-or-death determination. and i decide i'm gonna get this in 2 weeks or die trying. i don't know why this worked this time when i was so far off before, but it worked. many many things about the process changed. the writing changed, the arranging process changed, the vocal session changed drastically (for the better, in multiple ways) and the video session changed drastically. other changes too, in general, such as regimened morning walks to help kick off absolute peak productivity, which also serves as an escape moment to calm down because there is litterally no other time available on this time frame. so for some reason, i was magically able to sustain this 2-week stunt for 7 songs (with video included) in a row. it really seems like the best thing that's ever happened to me, it is reassuring, strengthening, revitalizing, ridiculously exciting, so good in so many ways. also completely and totally terrifying. the last 2 of those songs had their visual component nearly entirely made during the last 36 consecutive hours before release. in the christmas song, i recall screaming and having a total mental breakdown at 5pm on tuesday because i realized the 1st chorus sucks (visually) and i couldn't find a way to make it good. Anyway, something was starting to hit me, and it was the feeling that i need to integrate non-song videos into the schedule. but, being that the 2-week song release schedule was the best thing to ever happen to me, i was not going to give that up. so at this point (early december) i decided i should ADD another video (non-song) to the 2 week schedule, on the opposite week. so the 2 week song schedule would uninterrupted, but i would do a non-song additionally, in between. so essentially that means 1 video every week. If we stop and think about this, we can see that this is sheer greed right here, because about a year earlier, my 'dream schedule' was 2-weeks for a songvideo, and 2 weeks for a non-song, which back then was possible for non-songs but still wildly unattainable for songvideos. and NOW IT'S POSSIBLE as i proved 7 times in a row last fall. So essentially i am strong enough right now to actually do the dream schedule that was so sought after and unattainable last year. but instead, no, i insist on doubling it. here we see the greediness. december 2018, i failed at this, i attempted to do 'ball and stick' for tues dec 4 (the week in between the songs), and just couldn't get it done on time. then i frantically raced to try to still complete a song by the due date (dec 11), but it was chosen too quickly and on friday i noticed some serious problems with the choice, and had to abandon it, with nowhere near enough time to complete an entire song+music video in just 3 days. so in my greed to add non-song content to the 2 week schedule, i failed at the 2 week schedule. and ever since then i have been staggering along, injured and confused. for some reason, i still maintain that what i want is the 1+1 schedule (1 week per video, and alternating songvideo and nonsong). but that is very very very intense. i think the absolute quickest i've ever completed a songvideo might be about 10 days. of course also not helping the situation is the fact that after doing so many 2-week songs, i'm getting thirsty for a little more care and focus and new techniques. so i'm less willing to really make things suck. but for some reason i am still extremely attached to the 1 week schedule even though it is still quite a few steps over my head. oh well, i guess that's (ref: alexhonnold-impossiblepossible.mp4)ambition"

            "bill that may sound weird but do you have any tips on how to write down a melody without using sheet music but just a txt? something that includes the notes, whether they are going up or down, the rhythms, accents maybe, but without using traditional notation and generally not symbols (at least not many). not necessarily suitable for others to read, just for my reference. like what if i wanted to write down \"twinkle twinkle little star\" in the key of C. i thought of writing it down as (without including the tempo right now): TREBLE, C, 4/4: C(4)q-Cq+Gq+Gq|Aq-Aq_Gh|Fq-Fq_Eq-Eq|Dq-Dq_Ch so i'm using a dash when the pitch stays the same, a + when it ascends and an underscore when it descends. after the letter of the note i use q for quarter, h for half, i'd probably use h. for dotted half etc. but what would i do if i wanted to write staccato markings or slur notes together, or maybe write chords as well. i think as an idea it looked good at the beginning but i'm starting to see the impracticality of it",
            "i do have a system for this. if you want to really display 'enough' information, it's gonna be a lot of information. but i do it in 4 lines. (actually for the melody it's just 2 lines, notes and rhythm. but i usually have a nother line for lyric, and another line for chords). i was looking for an example on my phone but unfortunately all the examples are of songs that haven't been recorded yet, and as much as i would love to spoil a future song i'm not going to. but here is what it would look like for part of one of my songs, assuming i wrote this on a plane or something, which i did not, but this is whati would have done:\n\nand i /won't get mad about the /dream if you promise to be/lieve in me\n\n12/3 5 43 2 1/v5v3 ^3 /22 77 /7 1 v4 \n\n&a1e&&a e1a e3e a&1a& \n\n6m7 _2m7_1/5_5sus4_5 _ 2-7\nchord rhyth: 1 (2)& _ _ 1 _ 3 _ 1 (2) &\n\nok i actually included another line here for chord rhyth to make sure i got those anticipations. which i may or may not have done in real life because i may have figured out due to common sense that those are supposed to hit with the melody. ... But, basically as you can see, the melody line is numbers in the scale. there are no flats here but i would use b3, b7, etc if i needed those. slash marks there are just for extra redundant clarity, they mark the top of the bar. or in some cases i will use them at the half bar as well. those slashes are also something i always use in lyric sheets just for extra clarity. they don't specify the rhythm exactly, but they do provide some clarity as to where the top of the bar is. and the rhythm will be further clarified on the rhythm line. As for which octave the notes in, there is no exact formula, but it is generally assumed that the note will be the closest one. so 3 5 means the 5 is higher. and if when i'm writing it i feel like it won't be obvious, or if it's a big jump, i will use v or ^ to indicate the higher or lower octave. also a lot of times i use 8s or 9s, which can help to indicate the high 1 or 2. that of course would be a disaster beyond 9 because then it's 2 digit numbers and that would be a disaster. also i generally use spaces to approximate the rhythm (on the melody / lyric line), again this is not to exactly illustrate the rhythm, but at least it's a hint (the exact rhythm will be shown on the rhythm line.) when you first take a look at this notation having no memory of the idea weeks later, you need all the hints you can get.\nthen for the rhythm line, i'm using the 1e&a2e&a3e&a4e&a system, and i only write where the melody is. and again i use spaces in between for clarity. occasionally it's necessary to put the down beat number in parentheses if there's a big space. for example 1 &....i might wanna say 1   (2) &  to be sure if it's the & of 2 and not the & of 3. \nand for the chord line, i generally may specify if there is a smallest subdivision, like \"chords every 2 beat\" ... or, if i say 'chords every 1 beat', then i have an underscore line _ which means no chord there. so if i say '1 chord per beat' and then say C _ F C G _ _ _, that actually means the first C is 2 beats, and the G is 4 beats. make sense? using the underline marks to keep the time consistant. this stuff is all just an amalgamation of different writing tricks i've used, and if at all possible, it's best to also jump on an audio memo and sing SOMETHING. Also it's good to provide any additional information you can, as hints. definitely say what tempo. also say what key, if you think you know a good key, or if you think you know what key you are hearing it in. also if you are on a phone doing this, which is usually where you will need this, autocorrect will kick your ass the entire time. good luck"

I understand you probably think that your shit is far too complex to understand without rerecording vocals and rewriting English text, but I can assure you in the nicest way possible,",
            "are you sure this is the nicest way possible",
            "it is not. I think that people who don't speak English would just be appreciative of the fact that they have a translation of the video and would not ask for any more than that.",

            "I also think that a lot of people would prefer to enjoy your videos in their original format than have a redone one. and like you said, it is basically impossible (at this point in time at least) for you to make these kinds of redone videos. so the way see it is you have two options: keep community subtitles off and only let the English speakers understand what the fuck your saying, or turn them the fuck on and be fucking nice to people who weren't born in an English speaking country.",
            "i thought you said earlier you were going to be fucking nice",
            "I'm sorry but it makes me mad that you refuse to do a simple thing that would mean sooooo many more people would be able to enjoy your shit.",
            "if i was comfortable with it being released with the integrity of the material being significantly compromised and weakened, i would have possibly released it 3 months earlier with crappier graphics, no score, and worse narration. but instead i chose to spend the extra time to make it as good as possible, whilst zillions of people were breathing down my neck threatening to frown at me for not releasing it before it was done",
