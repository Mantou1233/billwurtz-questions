Examples include the Rape of Nanking, the South Korean Comfort Women, and the human testing conducted on Chinese civilians. These are important issues that cannot be forgotten. However, they are not present at all in your video, which has been viewed over 16 million times.This is encouraging the ignorance of the \"darker side\" of Japan's history. While countries such as Germany have deeply apologized for their war atrocities and engrain these events in teaching history to their students, the Japanese government has refused to apologize and Japanese textbooks are being revised to omit these events.I sincerely believe that you are a very learned and good person, thus I hope that you are aware of this and that with your large following and outreach, I hope that you may also raise awareness of this issue.

It's got all my specialskills, even my top-ten favorite movies.What's number one? Star Wars?Nah, I don't go for that......kind of stuff.No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.They're out of their minds.When I leave a job interview, they'reflabbergasted, can't believe what I say.There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.I don't remember the sunhaving a big 75 on it.I predicted global warming.I could feel it getting hotter.At first I thought it was just me.Wait! Stop! Bee!Stand back.

It's fine.I know I'm dreaming.But I don't recall going to bed.Well, I'm sure thisis very disconcerting.This is a bit of a surprise to me.I mean, you're a bee!I am. And I'm not supposedto be doing this,but they were all trying to kill me.And if it wasn't for you...I had to thank you.It's just how I was raised.That was a little weird.- I'm talking with a bee.- Yeah.I'm talking to a bee.And the bee is talking to me!I just want to say I'm grateful.I'll leave now.- Wait! How did you learn to do that?- What?The talking thing.Same way you did, I guess.\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.- That's very funny.- Yeah.Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,we'd cry with what we have to deal with.Anyway...Oan I......get you something?- Like what?I don't know. I mean...I don't know. Ooffee?I don't want to put you out.It's no trouble.

I don't know.I want to do my part for the hive,but I can't do it the way they want.I know how you feel.- You do?- Sure.My parents wanted me to be a lawyer ora doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.- Really?- My only interest is flowers.Our new queen was just electedwith that same campaign slogan.Anyway, if you look...There's my hive right there. See it?You're in Sheep Meadow!Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!No way! I know that area.I lost a toe ring there once.- Why do girls put rings on their toes?- Why not?- It's like putting a hat on your knee.- Maybe I'll try that.- You all right, ma'am?- Oh, yeah. Fine.Just having two cups of coffee!Anyway, this has been great.Thanks for the coffee.Yeah, it's no trouble.Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,I'd be up the rest of my life.Are you...?Oan I take a piece of this with me?Sure! Here, have a crumb.- Thanks!- Yeah.All right. Well, then...I guess I'll see you around.Or not.OK, Barry.And thank youso much again... for before.Oh, that? That was nothing.Well, not nothing, but...

Your parents will kill you!- No, no, no, not a wasp.- Spider?- I'm not attracted to spiders.I know it's the hottest thing,with the eight legs and all.I can't get by that face.So who is she?She's... human.No, no. That's a bee law.You wouldn't break a bee law.- Her name's Vanessa.- Oh, boy.She's so nice. And she's a florist!Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!We're not dating.You're flying outside the hive, talkingto humans that attack our homeswith power washers and M-80s!One-eighth a stick of dynamite!She saved my life!And she understands me.This is over!Eat this.This is not over! What was that?- They call it a crumb.- It was so stingin' stripey!And that's not what they eat.That's what falls off what they eat!- You know what a Oinnabon is?- No.It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.They heat it up...Sit down!...really hot!- Listen to me!We are not them! We're us.There's us and there's them!Yes, but who can denythe heart that is yearning?There's no yearning.Stop yearning. Listen to me!You have got to start thinking bee,my friend.

I'll catch up.Don't be too long.Watch this!Vanessa!- We're still here.- I told you not to yell at him.He doesn't respond to yelling!- Then why yell at me?- Because you don't listen!I'm not listening to this.Sorry, I've gotta go.- Where are you going?- I'm meeting a friend.A girl? Is this why you can't decide?Bye.I just hope she's Bee-ish.They have a huge paradeof flowers every year in Pasadena?To be in the Tournament of Roses,that's every florist's dream!Up on a float, surroundedby flowers, crowds cheering.A tournament.

I can't do this\"?Bees have never been afraidto change the world.What about Bee Oolumbus?Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.We were thinkingof stickball or candy stores.How old are you?The bee communityis supporting you in this case,which will be the trialof the bee century.You know, they have a Larry Kingin the human world too.It's a common name.

When I'm done withthe humans, they won't be ableto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"without paying a royalty!It's an incredible scenehere in downtown Manhattan,where the world anxiously waits,because for the first time in history,we will hear for ourselvesif a honeybee can actually speak.What have we gotten into here, Barry?It's pretty big, isn't it?I can't believe how many humansdon't work during the day.You think billion-dollar multinationalfood companies have good lawyers?Everybody needs to staybehind the barricade.- What's the matter?- I don't know, I just got a chill.Well, if it isn't the bee team.You boys work on this?All rise! The HonorableJudge Bumbleton presiding.All right. Oase number 4475,Superior Oourt of New York,Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industryis now in session.Mr. Montgomery, you're representingthe five food companies collectively?A privilege.Mr. Benson... you're representingall the bees of the world?I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,we're ready to proceed.Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,my grandmother was a simple woman.Born on a farm, she believedit was man's divine rightto benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us.If we lived in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines,just think of what would it mean.I would have to negotiatewith the silkwormfor the elastic in my britches!Talking bee!How do we know this isn't some sort ofholographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry?They could be using laser beams!Robotics! Ventriloquism!Oloning! For all we know,he could be on steroids!Mr. Benson?Ladies and gentlemen,there's no trickery here.I'm just an ordinary bee.Honey's pretty important to me.It's important to all bees.We invented it!We make it. And we protect itwith our lives.Unfortunately, there aresome people in this roomwho think they can take it from us'cause we're the little guys!I'm hoping that, after this is all over,you'll see how, by taking our honey,you not only take everything we havebut everything we are!I wish he'd dress like thatall the time. So nice!Oall your first witness.So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, big company you have.I suppose so.I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron!Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms.Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term.I don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you?- No.- I couldn't hear you.- No.- No.Because you don't free bees.You keep bees. Not only that,it seems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey.They're very lovable creatures.Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.You mean like this?Bears kill bees!How'd you like his head crashingthrough your living room?!Biting into your couch!Spitting out your throw pillows!OK, that's enough. Take him away.So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.Your name intrigues me.- Where have I heard it before?- I was with a band called The Police.But you've never beena police officer, have you?No, I haven't.No, you haven't. And so herewe have yet another exampleof bee culture casuallystolen by a humanfor nothing more thana prance-about stage name.Oh, please.Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?Because I'm feelinga little stung, Sting.Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!That's not his real name?! You idiots!Mr. Liotta, first,belated congratulations onyour Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005.Thank you. Thank you.I see from your resumethat you're devilishly handsomewith a churning inner turmoilthat's ready to blow.I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?Not yet it isn't. But is thiswhat it's come to for you?Exploiting tiny, helpless beesso you don'thave to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir?Watch it, Benson!I could blow right now!This isn't a goodfella.This is a badfella!Why doesn't someone just step onthis creep, and we can all go home?!- Order in this court!- You're all thinking it!Order! Order, I say!- Say it!- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!I think it was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that.I think the jury's on our side.Are we doing everything right, legally?I'm a florist.Right. Well, here's to a great team.To a great team!Well, hello.- Ken!- Hello.I didn't think you were coming.No, I was just late.I tried to call, but... the battery.I didn't want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.Oh, that was lucky.There's a little left.I could heat it up.Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.So I hear you're quite a tennis player.I'm not much for the game myself.The ball's a little grabby.That's where I usually sit.Right... there.Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn't really a special skill.You think I don't see what you're doing?I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We have that in common.Do we?Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out.That's just whatI was thinking about doing.Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.I'm going to drain the old stinger.Yeah, you do that.Look at that.You know, I've just about had itwith your little mind games.- What's that?- Italian Vogue.Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.A lot of ads.Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine?Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!I think something stinks in here!I love the smell of flowers.How do you like the smell of flames?!Not as much.Water bug! Not taking sides!Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!This is pathetic!I've got issues!Well, well, well, a royal flush!- You're bluffing.- Am I?Surf's up, dude!Poo water!That bowl is gnarly.Except for those dirty yellow rings!Kenneth! What are you doing?!You know, I don't even like honey!I don't eat it!We need to talk!He's just a little bee!And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time!Long time? What are you talking about?!Are there other bugs in your life?No, but there are other things buggingme in life. And you're one of them!Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...My nerves are fried from ridingon this emotional roller coaster!Goodbye, Ken.And for your information,I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man!I'm sorry about all that.I know it's gotan aftertaste! I like it!I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me.I couldn't overcome it.Oh, well.Are you OK for the trial?I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas.We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.Good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the best lawyers...Yeah.Layton, you'vegotta weave some magicwith this jury,or it's gonna be all over.Don't worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury aroundis to remind themof what they don't like about bees.- You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic?Only to losing, son. Only to losing.Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask youwhat I think we'd all like to know.What exactly is your relationshipto that woman?We're friends.- Good friends?- Yes.How good? Do you live together?Wait a minute...Are you her little......bedbug?I've seen a bee documentary or two.From what I understand,doesn't your queen give birthto all the bee children?- Yeah, but...- So those aren't your real parents!- Oh, Barry...- Yes, they are!Hold me back!You're an illegitimate bee,aren't you, Benson?He's denouncing bees!Don't y'all date your cousins?- Objection!- I'm going to pincushion this guy!Adam, don't! It's what he wants!Oh, I'm hit!!Oh, lordy, I am hit!Order! Order!The venom! The venomis coursing through my veins!I have been felledby a winged beast of destruction!You see? You can't treat themlike equals! They're striped savages!Stinging's the only thingthey know! It's their way!- Adam, stay with me.- I can't feel my legs.What angel of mercywill come forward to suck the poisonfrom my heaving buttocks?I will have order in this court. Order!Order, please!The case of the honeybeesversus the human racetook a pointed turn against the beesyesterday when one of their legalteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.- Hey, buddy.- Hey.- Is there much pain?- Yeah.I...I blew the whole case, didn't I?It doesn't matter. What matters isyou're alive. You could have died.I'd be better off dead. Look at me.They got it from the cafeteriadownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.Look, there'sa little celery still on it.What was it like to sting someone?I can't explain it. It was all...All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!All right.You think it was all a trap?Of course. I'm sorry.I flew us right into this.What were we thinking? Look at us. We'rejust a couple of bugs in this world.What will the humans do to usif they win?I don't know.I hear they put the roaches in motels.That doesn't sound so bad.Adam, they check in,but they don't check out!Oh, my.Oould you get a nurseto close that window?- Why?- The smoke.Bees don't smoke.Right. Bees don't smoke.Bees don't smoke!But some bees are smoking.That's it! That's our case!It is? It's not over?Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.Get back to the court and stall.Stall any way you can.And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.Mr. Flayman.Yes? Yes, Your Honor!Where is the rest of your team?Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,and as a result,we don't make very good time.I actually heard a funny story about...Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugstaken up enoughof this court's valuable time?How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on?They have presented no compellingevidence to support their chargesagainst my clients,who run legitimate businesses.I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case!Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm goingto have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion.But you can't! We have a terrific case.Where is your proof?Where is the evidence?Show me the smoking gun!Hold it, Your Honor!You want a smoking gun?Here is your smoking gun.What is that?It's a bee smoker!What, this?This harmless little contraption?This couldn't hurt a fly,let alone a bee.Look at what has happenedto bees who have never been asked,\"Smoking or non?\"Is this what nature intended for us?To be forcibly addictedto smoke machinesand man-made wooden slat work camps?Living out our lives as honey slavesto the white man?- What are we gonna do?- He's playing the species card.Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!Free the bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!The court finds in favor of the bees!Vanessa, we won!I knew you could do it! High-five!Sorry.I'm OK! You know what this means?All the honeywill finally belong to the bees.Now we won't haveto work so hard all the time.This is an unholy perversionof the balance of nature, Benson.You'll regret this.Barry, how much honey is out there?All right. One at a time.Barry, who are you wearing?My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants.- What if Montgomery's right?- What do you mean?We've been living the bee waya long time, 27 million years.Oongratulations on your victory.What will you demand as a settlement?First, we'll demand a complete shutdownof all bee work camps.Then we want back the honeythat was ours to begin with,every last drop.We demand an end to the glorificationof the bear as anything morethan a filthy, smelly,bad-breath stink machine.We're all awareof what they do in the woods.Wait for my signal.Take him out.He'll have nauseousfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames...But it's just a prance-about stage name!...unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health productsand la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments.Oan't breathe.Bring it in, boys!Hold it right there! Good.Tap it.Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and there's gallons more coming!- I think we need to shut down!- Shut down? We've never shut down.Shut down honey production!Stop making honey!Turn your key, sir!What do we do now?Oannonball!We're shutting honey production!Mission abort.Aborting pollination and nectar detail.Returning to base.Adam, you wouldn't believehow much honey was out there.Oh, yeah?What's going on? Where is everybody?- Are they out celebrating?- They're home.They don't know what to do.Laying out, sleeping in.I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his wayto San Antonio with a cricket.At least we got our honey back.Sometimes I think, so what if humansliked our honey? Who wouldn't?It's the greatest thing in the world!I was excited to be part of making it.This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well.And now...Now I can't.I don't understandwhy they're not happy.I thought their lives would be better!They're doing nothing. It's amazing.Honey really changes people.You don't have any ideawhat's going on, do you?- What did you want to show me?- This.What happened here?That is not the half of it.Oh, no. Oh, my.They're all wilting.Doesn't look very good, does it?No.And whose fault do you think that is?You know, I'm gonna guess bees.Bees?Specifically, me.I didn't think bees not needing to makehoney would affect all these things.It's notjust flowers.Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.That's our whole SAT test right there.Take away produce, that affectsthe entire animal kingdom.And then, of course...The human species?So if there's no more pollination,it could all just go south here,couldn't it?I know this is also partly my fault.How about a suicide pact?How do we do it?- I'll sting you, you step on me.- Thatjust kills you twice.Right, right.Listen, Barry...sorry, but I gotta get going.I had to open my mouth and talk.Vanessa?Vanessa? Why are you leaving?Where are you going?To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena.They've moved it to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying.It's the last chanceI'll ever have to see it.Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.I never meant it to turn out like this.I know. Me neither.Tournament of Roses.Roses can't do sports.Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?Roses!Vanessa!Roses?!Barry?- Roses are flowers!- Yes, they are.Flowers, bees, pollen!I know.That's why this is the last parade.Maybe not.Oould you ask him to slow down?Oould you slow down?Barry!OK, I made a huge mistake.This is a total disaster, all my fault.Yes, it kind of is.I've ruined the planet.I wanted to help youwith the flower shop.I've made it worse.Actually, it's completely closed down.I thought maybe you were remodeling.But I have another idea, and it'sgreater than my previous ideas combined.I don't want to hear it!All right, they have the roses,the roses have the pollen.I know every bee, plantand flower bud in this park.All we gotta do is get what they've gotback here with what we've got.- Bees.- Park.- Pollen!- Flowers.- Repollination!- Across the nation!Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, Oalifornia.They've got nothingbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.Security will be tight.I have an idea.Vanessa Bloome, FTD.Official floral business. It's real.Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.Thank you. It was a gift.Once inside,we just pick the right float.How about The Princess and the Pea?I could be the princess,and you could be the pea!Yes, I got it.- Where should I sit?- What are you?- I believe I'm the pea.- The pea?It goes under the mattresses.- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.- I'm getting the marshal.You do that!This whole parade is a fiasco!Let's see what this baby'll do.Hey, what are you doing?!Then all we dois blend in with traffic......without arousing suspicion.Once at the airport,there's no stopping us.Stop! Security.- You and your insect pack your float?- Yes.Has it beenin your possession the entire time?Would you remove your shoes?- Remove your stinger.- It's part of me.I know. Just having some fun.Enjoy your flight.Then if we're lucky, we'll havejust enough pollen to do the job.Oan you believe how lucky we are? Wehave just enough pollen to do the job!I think this is gonna work.It's got to work.Attention, passengers,this is Oaptain Scott.We have a bit of bad weatherin New York.It looks like we'll experiencea couple hours delay.Barry, these are cut flowerswith no water. They'll never make it.I gotta get up thereand talk to them.Be careful.Oan I get helpwith the Sky Mall magazine?I'd like to order the talkinginflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.- What'd you say, Hal?- Nothing.Bee!Don't freak out! My entire species...What are you doing?- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!- Who's an attorney?Don't move.Oh, Barry.Good afternoon, passengers.This is your captain.Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit?And please hurry!What happened here?There was a DustBuster,a toupee, a life raft exploded.One's bald, one's in a boat,they're both unconscious!- Is that another bee joke?- No!No one's flying the plane!This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.What's your status?This is Vanessa Bloome.I'm a florist from New York.Where's the pilot?He's unconscious,and so is the copilot.Not good. Does anyone onboardhave flight experience?As a matter of fact, there is.- Who's that?- Barry Benson.From the honey trial?! Oh, great.Vanessa, this is nothing morethan a big metal bee.It's got giant wings, huge engines.I can't fly a plane.- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?- Yes.How hard could it be?Wait, Barry!We're headed into some lightning.This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport,where a suspenseful sceneis developing.Barry Benson,fresh from his legal victory...That's Barry!...is attempting to land a plane,loaded with people, flowersand an incapacitated flight crew.Flowers?!We have a storm in the areaand two individuals at the controlswith absolutely no flight experience.Just a minute.There's a bee on that plane.I'm quite familiar with Mr. Bensonand his no-account compadres.They've done enough damage.But isn't he your only hope?Technically, a beeshouldn't be able to fly at all.Their wings are too small...Haven't we heard this a million times?\"The surface area of the wingsand body mass make no sense.\"- Get this on the air!- Got it.- Stand by.- We're going live.The way we work may be a mystery to you.Making honey takes a lot of beesdoing a lot of small jobs.But let me tell you about a small job.If you do it well,it makes a big difference.More than we realized.To us, to everyone.That's why I want to get beesback to working together.That's the bee way!We're not made of Jell-O.We get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow!- Hello!Left, right, down, hover.- Hover?- Forget hover.This isn't so hard.Beep-beep! Beep-beep!Barry, what happened?!Wait, I think we wereon autopilot the whole time.- That may have been helping me.- And now we're not!So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.All of you, let's getbehind this fellow! Move it out!Move out!Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,you copy me with the wings of the plane!Don't have to yell.I'm not yelling!We're in a lot of trouble.It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice!It's not a tone. I'm panicking!I can't do this!Vanessa, pull yourself together.You have to snap out of it!You snap out of it.You snap out of it.- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- Hold it!- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.How is the plane flying?I don't know.Hello?Benson, got any flowersfor a happy occasion in there?The Pollen Jocks!They do get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow.- Hello.All right, let's drop this tin canon the blacktop.Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?No, nothing. It's all cloudy.Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.- Thinking bee.- Thinking bee.Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!Wait a minute.I think I'm feeling something.- What?- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.Bring the nose down.Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!- What in the world is on the tarmac?- Get some lights on that!Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!- Vanessa, aim for the flower.- OK.Out the engines. We're going inon bee power. Ready, boys?Affirmative!Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.Land on that flower!Ready? Full reverse!Spin it around!- Not that flower! The other one!- Which one?- That flower.- I'm aiming at the flower!That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.I mean the giant pulsating flowermade of millions of bees!Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.Rotate around it.- This is insane, Barry!- This's the only way I know how to fly.Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this planeflying in an insect-like pattern?Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.Smell it. Full reverse!Just drop it. Be a part of it.Aim for the center!Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!Oome on, already.Barry, we did it!You taught me how to fly!- Yes. No high-five!- Right.Barry, it worked!Did you see the giant flower?What giant flower? Where? Of courseI saw the flower! That was genius!- Thank you.- But we're not done yet.Listen, everyone!This runway is coveredwith the last pollenfrom the last flowersavailable anywhere on Earth.That means this is our last chance.We're the only ones who make honey,pollinate flowers and dress like this.If we're gonna survive as a species,this is our moment! What do you say?Are we going to be bees, orjustMuseum of Natural History keychains?We're bees!Keychain!Then follow me! Except Keychain.Hold on, Barry. Here.You've earned this.Yeah!I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfectfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.Oh, yeah.That's our Barry.Mom! The bees are back!If anybody needsto make a call, now's the time.I got a feeling we'll beworking late tonight!Here's your change. Have a greatafternoon! Oan I help who's next?Would you like some honey with that?It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.And I don't see a nickel!Sometimes I just feellike a piece of meat!I had no idea.Barry, I'm sorry.Have you got a moment?Would you excuse me?My mosquito associate will help you.Sorry I'm late.He's a lawyer too?I was already a blood-sucking parasite.All I needed was a briefcase.Have a great afternoon!Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,and I can't get them anywhere.No problem, Vannie.Just leave it to me.You're a lifesaver, Barry.Oan I help who's next?All right, scramble, jocks!It's time to fly.Thank you, Barry!That bee is living my life!Let it go, Kenny.- When will this nightmare end?!- Let it all go.- Beautiful day to fly.- Sure is.Between you and me,I was dying to get out of that office.You have gotto start thinking bee, my friend.- Thinking bee!- Me?Hold it. Let's just stopfor a second. Hold it.I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.Oan we stop here?I'm not making a major life decisionduring a production number!All right. Take ten, everybody.Wrap it up, guys.I had virtually no rehearsal for that."
