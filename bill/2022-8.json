            "i wasn't necessarily thinking of flying here. it looks like i was just continuing the same soft prosey strategy. again, i could have been as late as \"was\" and still had no idea exactly *when* (rhythmically) the line might end. and yet i certainly knew what the meaning of the phrase was by the time i hit \"travel the distance\". the rest of the line is sort of an exercise in free will to see how many times i could surprise myself with number of syllables the sentence turned out to actually have. despite already knowing from the beginning of the line what information it was going to be paraphrasing (travel from point A to point B)",
            "\"the sky is falling\"\nOkay this gets interesting-",
            "i think it's the least interesting part so far. sounds like it was lifted from some nursery rhyme",
            "in your video \"gonna clean my room\" the song goes that you'll clean your room after the 'sun burns out' and the 'sky falls down' so there's an interesting connection, added on top of that 'sun is not very bright' coincided with 'sun burns out.'",
            "the sky and sun have been up there all my life. so they both commonly come to mind often. so that 'connection' is probably shared by a huge percentage of my songs. unless i'm deliberately trying to cut back",
            "And another cool thing- 'sun burns out and the sky falls down' is also pretty similar to the line from 'mount saint helens' - 'sun falls down and the sky burns out.' I suppose in general a lot of your music conveys apocalyptic emotions and references so perhaps 'sun is not ver y bright' and 'the sky is falling' were merely intuition ..but then I thought deeper.. the song as a whole... And I realized given all the present themes of the future being upon us and reconciling that with the memories of our past, maybe all this really does take place farther along upon a vast timeline, where the sun may really be slowly dying out and no longer radiates light to the extent of our own. And all this talk of the sun and skies still connects it all back to 'flying around'. His arms are supposedly too tired to talk about it, maybe from flying, or maybe even because he doesn't want to talk about it.\n\"the sky is larger \nthan any sky can be\"\nThis builds on 'sky is falling\" describing how unimaginably and unbelievably vast the sky truly is, presumably as seen from the perspective of one flying across it.",
            "i guarantee i was not thinking about flying at this point. given the carefree attitude of this song, i'd assume that pretty much everything in here so far, including the sandals, sky, the flying, are part of a floaty collage of aesthetics here",
            "\"oo, ah, oh, ee\nmy calendar is telling me it's the future\"\nI remember you talking about this sorta lyrical device in an answer to a question about balancing phrases and musical non-words, and this truly masters that- the punch and impact in this chorus is really felt.",
            "in addition to that technique, i also used another balancing trick on a doubled timescale here, which is where half the page is filled with words (etc), and the other half of the page just has 1 word. (future). so it sort of invokes a comparison of \"everything to 1\". which is an interesting ratio for those following along mathematically",
            "\"somewhere there's a second scene\nwith characters that never speak\nbut you still know exactly what they mean\nand you still know exactly what the story will be\" \nThis 'second scene' musically illustrates a depiction of characters who despite never exchanging any dialogue you still know what they are saying, the way a drawing conveys a story without any words.\n\"i travel the world without my blanket\nso when i'm feeling tired\ni can just... fly around\"\nThis is very tongue-in-cheek contradictory all around yet elicits such powerful feelings and is honestly really musically beautiful.",
            "seems like a double negative is achieved in that line somehow. again probably attempting to dream while i'm awake. sometimes saying things backwards is a nice way to throw off the boring non-dreaming part of the brain. which i suppose would be the frontal lobe for those of you following along neurologically",
            "\"most people wonder if the moon is part of the sky\nor if it's just a decoration added later\"\nThis line retains the themes of out-of-our-world observations of the sun and skies from the previous verses upon titularly flying around. It also retains a merit of scientific accuracy given as you've said in your own words: ''holy sh*t we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks- and it kind of made a mess. which is&#127926;now the moon&#127926;.' In essence this line maybe asks the question 'is the moon really real?' And while being musically a melodic 'echo' of 'sun is not very bright'",
            "i can tell you that the musical/lyrical echo is the primary reason for this line's existence. i guess it's that part of the second verse where it's time to be mildly responsible in the songwriting. it echoes the 'some people wonder', and instead of \"sun\" it's \"moon\", which felt like the standard verse 1 to 2 transferrence. and the rest of the line is just the best option i could come up with for finishing it. it also seems to generally play a 3rd above the first verse's line, (not to mention an actual harmony added above it here) which playes into the mention of 'decoration', and it is 'later' in 2 ways actually, because the this verse's line comes later than the first, but, also because the vocal singing the higher harmony here came later than the lead",
            "the question simultaneously implies the same feeling the statement 'the sky is larger than any sky ca n be' does.",
            "possibly true",
            "\"oo, ah, oh, ee\nmy galaxy is spinning toward the future\"\nContinuing to tie in visualizations of beyond-our-world intergalactic wonders, this line ties in both time and space.",
            "i recall 'galaxy' being some kind of freudian slip at one point while i was running through the first bridge. so i earmarked it for the second",
            "\"somewhere in the 7th scene\nwhen no one understands the point of view\nthat you now find so familiar\"\n'7th scene' captures the feeling that we've moved on a little bit further into this story's future",
            "true",
            "and also makes for a zesty rhyme with '2nd scene.' But really this line truly speaks for itself- it finds this whole analysis to be ironic. We can't fully understand the point of view that the artist finds so familiar. But that's the beauty of storytelling and songwriting.",
            "i can tell you that a big part of the reason this line is built the way it is is to juggle the rhythm and surprise myself as much as possible. basically to keep the sentence going as long as possible, causing a long string of 'challenges' to the rhythm and then see if i can maneuver it into a musically and linguistically coherent landing. it's kind of like when pilots repeatedly try to damage their airplane while in flight, to challenge themselves to create increasingly more interesting landings. But, besides the rhythm and music there, the words are also describing when you get that much deeper into a story and you've developed a deeper familiarity with the story's world that those outside this story might not share",
            "\"oh\nmy memori es are coming back in ways i wasn't ready for\nbut i'm still enjoying the way it feels\"\nThis line hits right in the feels.",
            "that is generally the preferred target to hit, as per company policy",
            "Also the 'oh' later transforms into 'oooh' later in the song- I just noticed that.",
            "i'll grab any souvenir i can, for proof of not copy-pasting",
            "\"so i'm holding onto the details\ncapture this moment\nin a series of carefully chosen words and phrases\nand then replay it\"\nThis is an interesting sorta meta realization and description of songwriting, the literal feeling of capturing a feeling.. or a memory ..or a memory being made there and then.",
            "i basically poured my heart out in the previous couple of lines, and i understood that i'd probably completely submerged myself beyond any chance of getting myself back out in any 'normal'ish way, so, ....... i sort of figured i might as well become an alien at this point...... froze the harmony on a sort of ambiguosly not-really-stable but not-really-unstable, semi-awkward place, and then rigidly went to prose to literally explain what a diligent artist surely often tries to do, in situations where they encounter an inspiring situation or moment. simply try to capture it, like a scientist would capture some kind of specimen",
            "\"walk over the earth in special sandals\ni kick those sandals off\nand watch them fly around\"\nFlipp ing and twisting the opening line around and in on itself to expand upon it in a new perspective in a new verse.",
            "yep, i am a flipsman all too frequently i will confess",
            "\"i didn't notice\nif they ever landed\nbut if they do i'll understand the reason\"\nOf course alluding to the law of gravity, but also still (purposefully or not) tying in with the other apparent 'scientific' details in this song such as the sun's dwindling illumination and the moon's decorative origins.",
            "actually, i was just trying to promote unconditional understanding. \"if ____ happens, i'll understand.\" more of a spiritual vibe here",
            "\"oh, ah, oo, ee\nthe melody is drifting into the future\"\nThe melody literally drifts into the future in spectacular key change faction. The vocal non-words are even rearranged so you really feel that 'oo'!",
            "while also eagerly taking the chance to prove i did not copy-paste",
            "\"and i feel pretty good\nabout what time it  is\nabout what day it ever was and how it came to this\"\nA feeling of content with the past and how we got here, and maybe even a glimpse of hope for the future.\n\"ooooh\"\n'dangmmmmmm..' \n\"the memory is drifting back in ways that i'll\npretend to know and understand\nand i pretend to know exactly how the story will end\"\nMyself and I'm sure so many others know this feeling, it's so human to think, feel, and perhaps hope you know what will happen next. This completes the themes of storytelling within this song- from knowing what the story will be to pretending you know how it will end. And that story stretches beyond fiction into our own personal narratives, of the past, present and future. No one else really understands that narrative. That's  where art is sparked and discovered within and throughout and beyond. I really appreciate your music and what you do, thank you for the songs you write and the art you share. \n\"travel the\nwalk over the\ninto the\nback to the\"\nOf course I'm sure this is self explanatory, following the previous lyric. Yes, the meaning is very immediate.\n'back to the...' ...future.The true meaning of the song is back to the future. time travel through alternate realities with marty mcflie (tom holland) and doc ock",
            "for me, a back to the future reference would have michael j fox instead, but, it's not a back to the future reference. these last vocals are trying to increase the chances that you will want to go back to the beginning and listen again"

Think of it like this: music is the beverage. the context/words/scene is the cup. imagine a beverage with no cup. same beverage...... undrinkable. Also, a cup without a beverage can be pretty bland also.

And for the in-the-office experience, there are hopefully some things you can do to settle in and get more comfortable.

The melody, for the verse, however, is extremely personal and i stand by that. never found a lyric that really captures what i honestly am feeling in that melody. the best expression of that line is when it's done instrumentally later. the staring at the flag pole is not quite genuine either, except actually given the circumstance, it is, if you account for the fact that i'm halfway through a song that did not necessarily start well (lyrically), so as i stare at the flag pole in this moment i can let the original melody come back to me, hopefully to catch a glimpse of it slightly closer to its original form",

Of the rest of the songs, wh ile they're good, they generally don't have the immediate tension that songs starting on the 4 do. Maybe it shouldn't be surprising that different chords sound different.
