When you're trying to the 2 week schedule thing, why not post the song (just the audio) on your website when that's finished, as opposed to waiting for the video to be done as well? Do you think the video is more effective/enjoyable if it's a song we haven't heard before? Like, do you think us knowing the song before the video comes out would be like 'spoiling the surprise' or whatever? People liked the movie star video even though that song was posted before the video. Again, I'm not particularly suggesting you do this. Just curious why you've decided against it?",

            "well, computer programs actually sometimes do call it 24th notes, just because it's consistent, mathematically. But, ... in writing it is usually called some type of triplet or sextuplet. in your situation, i would prefer to call it \"16th note triplets\" for clarity's sake, although i'm sure people would just say 'sextuplets' and assume you know what they mean. i prefer to write it as a group of 6 notes, double beam, except only a single beam between the 3rd and 4th notes. so 2 groups of 3 16th notes, connected in the middle by a single beam. you can put the triplet arc (and number 3) over each group of 3. or if you want i guess you could put one arc over the whole thing and put 6. that works too, i guess. i hope that answers your question"

And because I know \"C\" i can figure out every other note too(maybe I'm not explaining this right) my point is i can figure out any notes to a thing as long as I think from \"C\" first. I explained this to my teacher and he was like \"that's perfect pitch\" but I always thought perfect pitch was effortless.",

In fact, such machines are specifically and carefully programmed to eliminate randomness in results. They do this by following rules and relying on algorithms when they compute.\"\n\nYou can program a machine to generate what can be called \"random\" numbers, but the machine is always at the mercy of its programming. \"On a completely det erminist ic machine you can't generate anything you could really call a random sequence of numbers,\" says Ward, \"because the machine is following the same algorithm to generate them. Typically, that means it starts with a common 'seed' number and then follows a pattern.\" The results may be sufficiently complex to make the pattern difficult to identify, but because it is ruled by a carefully defined and consistently repeated algorithm, the numbers it produces are not truly random. \"They are what we call 'pseudo-random' numbers,\" Ward says.\n\n- MIT School of Engineering\n\nHow do you feel about this? Will you stay with your stance of preferring computers to eliminate accidental reasoning or have you been influenced to believe that the machine can never trump human creativity",

I have a lot of music and artwork that I want to put online (maybe make my own website, but I gotta figure out how to do that)... but I'm kind of torn because, and again maybe I'm being childish, but I'm afraid to share it because I'm afraid of being ridiculed. There's a lot of heavy, deeply personal stuff that comes out in my lyrics and my drawings that I have never expressed or shared with the people I know. And if any of them see it, it would be dropping a huge bombshell on them, changing their perceptions of me. I'm not really afraid of people not liking it, moreso just people thinking 'what the fuck, man'... I have no problems sharing the stuff I make with complete strangers.. but the thought of having friends or family see it is just downright terrifying for me (nobody even knows that I draw or write lyrics/sing...

            "seems a bit like you underestimate instrumental music?",
            "no, trust me, i am Hard-Wired as an instrumental musician. in my childhood i listened to only instrumental music, and didn't know how to really deal with anything else. the first many years of my musical development were vastly instrumental only. mostly artists who's music was marketed as instrumental music, in its own right. but there is an elephant in the room, which everyone always thinks about, which is \"why do those instrumental artists never seem to be as successful as non-instrumental artists, even though *we* (musicians) 'know' they're 'better' \" etc etc sad face. i just didn't feel like going along with such a sad conclusion so i was driven to understand, so i erased everything i knew and started listening to pop radio all day. anyway, that's beside the point, what i'm trying to say is, over time it became crystal clear that instrumental music operates in the back part of your brain, but the labels, the handles, the latches, the characters, the *cognition* as the scientists would call it, happens in the 'front' part of your brain. i guess it's called the frontal lobe, or the neo-cortex, or whatever .. (not a brain expert really) but it's kind of like where you file things. it's what you name things. even if the *feelings* and the deep stuff are all happening on a much deeper level, you will always have them 'filed' or 'named' in a particular way. and each person may file things differently. but that's what i realized about instrumental music. vastly powerful, usually doing most of the real heavy lifting in terms of actually making the over-all product feel good, does all work in terms of pulling the heartstrings, BUT the frontal 'handles' (characters, words, names, titles, etc etc, the frontal stuff) will always seem to get the credit. that's just the way it works. and the same is true for my childhood listening to instrumental music -- for example, let's say an album of instrumental music is sold under a particular musician's name, and they play a certain instrument (let's say it's piano). that's the 'frontal' content, the label / title etc... in other words, when you listen to it, you are 'cognizant' of the fact that you are listening to a piano player's music. you are aware that that is what's happening. so if that reality is something you are comfortable with, then you will be comfortable listening to that music. where-as, take for example, a movie, with scenes in it about troubles in a relationship due to long distance separation, etc etc etc, but it happens to be underscored by piano. you are still listening to instrumental piano music, but you whole idea of what's happening will be different. you will probably think of it as 'i'm watching this scene in a movie about these characters etc this is what's going on\" rather than \"i'm listening to piano music\" ... now not everyone necessarily files things the same way, because for example someone interested in film scoring could easily be listening to it and hearing the underscoring, and that's likely a main reason they would be watching the movie, to specifically enjoy the underscoring. but even so, that reality is still different from listening to a piano player's album, because the film-scoring person is not just listening to the score, but they are listening to it from a film-scorers perspective. when we are studying and learning things, that often determines the angle we focus on. another example, let's say it comes from a video game. the music will have all it's power but it will be connected with the game, and the game will again act as the 'handle' or 'filing system' that sort of 'delivers' the music to the listener, and in turn the music is richly juicing up the contents of the game, to feel so much more meaning, and again usually the 'handles' (the content of the game) will get all the credit. unless, again, it is a music student or a musician listening, in which case That would be their 'handle.' so even when instrumental music seems to be purely insrumental with nothing else, there is always some context in which the listener heard it. for example, let's say you are walking down the street and all of a sudden you randomly hear instrumental music coming out of a fire-hydrant. well guess what, that's not just detached music, that's music you heard coming out of that fire hydrant, and when you tell the story you will always remember that music as the music that was coming out of that fire hydrant. so in that sense the only way to actually have completely unfiled unassociated instrumental music is if you were hearing the music and you literally don't know where it's coming from and you also don't know where you are, and also don't remember the circumstances that led to you not knowing where you are. so basically my point is that yes truly and surely instrumental music has all the powers. but it is made of liquid and you really can't drink any of it unless you have a cup",
