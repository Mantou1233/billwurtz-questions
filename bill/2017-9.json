(ref: duck-example-wayne.mp3)here is a simple example from lil wayne, over the course of 2 bars, where the landing point of the first half is on the 4th quarter of the first half, and then the landing point of the second half is halfway thru the second half, making it on the 4th quarter of the entire thing."

That's how good time works! it can speed up or slow down, but there is always the same amount of 'water', and when people aren't very good at keeping time, there are these wedges in the river where there is empty space.\" I love this analogy but I still don't fully understand the \"water\" part in terms of music.

Using the same math... I found that Mercury and Venus are both closest to A. Earth and Mars are closest to G. Jupiter is closest to Bb. Saturn is closest to A. Uranus is closest to C#. Neptune is closest to D. So our solar system is playing, like a Gm9#11 chord? Why such a sad, weird, dissonant chord do you think? Why does our solar system feel like that? Pluto would be closest to B... which would make the chord even weirder.... I don't even know what you'd name that chord. Maybe this is why scientists don't want to make pluto a planet???",

            "hey Bill, i just read your update on the new project and how you are looking for faster ways to make videos. This is a very relevant issue for me as well, and i have some ideas that might be of use... i started out making everything in After Effects (i dont know what software you use but this should be relevant regardless) which is great and amazing but non efficient especially when you have a identity of textures and tones that is some kind of starting point and a through line through all your different projects but reusing previous stuff from other After Effects projects feels werid and is not ideal. i have recently been learning a coding language called Processing which i am using to create programs to execute visuals before i bring them into After Effects. For a a hopefully relevant example to you, i could make a program where i can type in text, have a rgb slider for base color of text, create duplicates of text on top of one another with differ ent colo rs and choose a display style like a repeating pattern of text or a silly wobble distortion or something. Then i can save the text as a picture or video and then do the polishing in After Effects. These little programs you can make for various reasons and reused without loosing freshness or constraints as you can easily add a few parameters to the code for every projects adding on to the base you have built up which you can execute and use immediately. The beginning of this process is the worst by far and takes time but it seems to me like the efficiency ratio is a constant upward line with no plateauing and from your knowledge of html from making this website, i think the starting momentum would not be too terribly slow. this might be helpful to you, thank you for changing the world all the time",

Working completely alone is a different thing. it means you can't use actors, you can't have camera operators, .... you are limited to entirely different mediums, like animation, etc. and that is very hard work. like i said, it depends on your level of difficulty in working with others. if you really really can't do it (like i can't) then it might be worth it to re-imagine your entire career around things you can do yourself. at least until you have more resources. nowadays you can get further than ever working alone"

            "I have a lot of music written. Some of its fully recorded, some it's partially recorded, some it's just written out in paper. But, I have a good solid base of stuff to go off of. But right now, I'm stuck in a MAJOR rut. Like, what do I do with all this music? The logical thing I think would be pairing music with videos, graphics, or some kind of visual aspect. But the thing is, I've never really felt the \"calling\" of being a video-maker. It's not really something I'm passionate about at all, in the same way I am about making music... and if im not passionate about it, why even do it? Even if I do decide to at least try making videos, I have no experience in it and wouldn't even know where to begin... Also, I feel like just making videos for the sake of pairing something up with my music isn't a good strategy since it would just be like forcing 2 things together instead of creating something with sound and visuals together that go hand and hand as pa rt of a whole. I have some songs that I think can stand alone, like more traditional verse/chorus stuff with vocals... but most of my stuff is like weird little instrumental pieces, like 10 seconds to a minute in length, which I don't think would make much sense on their own (when I wrote them I had certain images in mind, like this song reminds me of a mad scientists tinkering with a bunch of test-tubes and bubbling chemicals, this song sounds like you just got \"game over\" in a video game, this song sounds like you just had an idea and a light bulb went off over your head, this song sounds like your taking a walk and then something crazy jumps out in front of you, this one sounds like you tried to do something epic but then failed in an anticlimactic way at the very end, etc)... sorry for this long rambling text. But I just feel like I've been standing in front of the same hurdle for a very long time and have no ideas how to jump over it and it's disheartening. If you have any advi ce for m e, I'd really appreciate it. Like should I just force myself to try to learn how to make videos, and hope that over time I learn to enjoy it, get better at it, and find my own voice/style? Or should I seek alternate routes (which routes, I don't know) that don't involve me making videos?",
            "well, if you really don't want to find any way to make videos but you feel like the material has to go with something visually (which i think is probably right) then you might consider finding someone else who wants to make the videos. or, another approach would be to find people that make videos and they are looking for music, and you could write music to their videos. neither of these options work for me because i am a control freak and i live under a rock. but because of that, i knew i had no choice but to learn how to make the videos myself. but if you don't want to do that you might try to explore some collaborative options"

THEN i jumped in at the deep end by accepting a task, which is this play. in fact i was going to refuse but i had to accept, 'they' made m e. the m ain theme they gave to me was very common, but safe and i was given enough time to write. for like a week i didn't even start, i didn't think about it and then i remembered and i said \"okay, you know what, fuck this. they want me to do what everyone else does. i'll give them and the audience the theme they want, but i'll do it my way.\" and i started to write nonstop, contextualizing the subject in a way no one ever dared before. i didn't care, i was just writing and soon i realized it's finished in just eight hours. because of this success i was feeling confident, i sent them the script saying \"listen to me, i am your only chance to put this play on the stage in time, here is my script, i know it's crazy but i also know it's good, accept it or accept it, i won't be directing anything other than this.\" politely. and they LOVED it, i must admit that i was surprised. the play will be staged three months later (which is also a short time like eight hours for a play but i'll handle it) and i might do voice acting. i'm sure they will cut out the best scenes 'because it's not appropriate' but doesn't matter. the important thing is i have the original script i have written and one day i will be able to revive it the way i want. after the play is performed i'll continue with small but fast steps because i still don't feel ready to run, just like i said before it's just the beginning. so here comes the questi on, is m y situation somehow similar to how you started doing your contents?",

I don't have any recording equipment at home to experiment with.. but do you think this technique would work? Any tips or advice on how to make it sound extra crisp and natural?",
