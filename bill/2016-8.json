(and still Bb) and i also am feeling the presence still of Eb (or maybe even Db) dirtying it up just a bit, which would mean either C7#9 or C7b9, but the presence of that note is extremely subtle (as well it should be) and might possibly just be the reverb ringing over from the previous chord.  so OL is Caug7#9 and 'dies' is C7 with possible very subtle #9. the melody and bass notes are much stronger than the harmony notes, as they should be"

But it became clear that he always wanted a real relationship with me, and I wanted to keep things casual, so we drifted apart. About a year has gone by. I just found out he has a girlfriend now. The problem is, I REALLY want to hook up with him again. It's all I think about all day. I think I might be able to convince him to cheat on his gf with me (since he was always really into me), but that feels wrong. I could also try to break them up by pretending like I finally DO want to date him, and then just use him for sex for a while. But that option also feels wrong. A third option might be to ask for a threesome with him and his gf, but I doubt she'd consent to a threesome with one of his former lovers, and plus I don't know if I really want to hook up with a woman anyway.
