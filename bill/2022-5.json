I'm getting way more music done than I have been in months. But it feels *too* easy, if that makes sense. Like I could come up with a lot more creative and imaginative stuff if I wasn't just hypnotically pumping out the same stuff I'd always done.\n\nI guess my question is, is it possible for creative projects to be *too* easy to make?

Then for the production cycle due on 4/19/22, this song was selected, purely based on the musical riff, and again with the caveat that the \"corner store) will NOT be the primary lyric, nor the title. The first several hours of the songwriting session were promptly spent trying vehemently to come up with something 'better' than the corner store line. vague themes of morning/awakening were floating around, some sort of idea of some kind of congregation or club, feelings of renewal, ..... these were the vibes i was going for, but i never came up with anything that fit.

However, the problem is that the best resets take way too much time to do. So if you actually want to get it done, you need a force-reset, and what i typically do is walk over and touch the door handle and come back (then start the run-through). That works a little bit, but not always. What i've discovered recently might be much more effective is to go to the shower and put your face under the cold water.
