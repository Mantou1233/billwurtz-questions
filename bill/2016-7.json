Also the reader will have more time to read it if it's the only chord on a page. but if it is in a song where regular D chords are also used, then i would def. just say D2/4 and it's players choice if u wanna open it all up like that"

            "Dear Sir:I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.Yours truly,Prince Alyusi Islassis",

I'm not sure where people stand on this issue. i just can't take being accused of not doing something i AM doing, AND it is something i want to do. i want to do them both, so it is very difficult to see where to go here. in a way, i want to start doing songs every week, like NOW, but at the same time i gotta get this history video done. Even people who defend me say \"hey, he only wanted to make history of japan, that was a one-time deal. leave him alone.\" but it's NOT a one-time deal whatsoever. japan was just a test run of a much greater realm of the research format. So either way i am stuck. it's a lot like how i felt stuck between vine and history, before the history video came out, everyone thought i was an 'idiot' and 'irresponsible' for not following through on more vines. it's hard to figure out who is in the majority, and i don't think i should. i saw a content creator try to do a voting system for what the fans thought he should do, and i was honestly very turned off by the idea. i was thinking \"you're the dude, i'm following YOU, ... if you're the leader and you don't know where to go, that's not a very strong sign of leadership.\" so i generally try to stay away from trying to go strictly where the majority would say i should go. besides, if i did that, there's no way i would have taken the risk to do history of japan when i already had a vibrant vine following. so ultimately i have to do what i think is right, and i am extremely torn between songs and big videos at this juncture, but this particular video is turning out to be really large and epic and i think it is exactly what needs to happen right now. and it could easily take a few more months if i work SOLIDLY on it. who knows what may happen if i try to take detours and do songs.... that will make it take even longer, and imagine how much more intense the lectures will get"

The times i prefer to use capitals are in acronyms (like NAFTA, or UNESCO), sometimes at the beginning of sentences if i feel i am changing gear or tone (similar to the way you might use a paragraph break) or also when i want to emphasize one word, i may capitalize the first letter of that word, creating something similar to a <b>bold</b> effect. it is a nice surefire way to emphasize a word even if it is not guaranteed that the 'bold' effect is available, and it is more Mild than the more 'screaming' style of ALL CAPS. then again, when i am trying to convey something of maximum urgency i might possibly use all caps"

            "my original goal was to make it somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. writing the script now, and it clocks in at about 5:40 and i JUST got to what is supposed to be the \"main topic\" of the video. it's like if you are making a video about fruit, and you are 5 minutes into the video and you just got to the part that talks about the fruit. So that tells me that the total length of the video should probably be at least double what i have so far. If i can get it to work in 10min, that would be great. if it goes up to 15 min and stays engaging and interesting all the way through, i think that would be fine. Japan video was 9, and it took 98 days of solid work to finish it, but i was also doing 6 second vines every day for most of that time, which i am now not doing. also i have probably learned some things from experience and perhaps things will move faster. then again, this video might require many new kinds of graphics tricks. i am working as fast as possible, as always"

It's fine.I know I'm dreaming.But I don't recall going to bed.Well, I'm sure thisis very disconcerting.This is a bit of a surprise to me.I mean, you're a bee!I am. And I'm not supposedto be doing this,but they were all trying to kill me.And if it wasn't for you...I had to thank you.It's just how I was raised.That was a little weird.- I'm talking with a bee.- Yeah.I'm talking to a bee.And the bee is talking to me!I just want to say I'm grateful.I'll leave now.- Wait! How did you learn to do that?- What?The talking thing.Same way you did, I guess.\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.- That's very funny.- Yeah.Bees are funny.

I don't know.I want to do my part for the hive,but I can't do it the way they want.I know how you feel.- You do?- Sure.My parents wanted me to be a lawyer ora doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.- Really?- My only interest is flowers.Our new queen was just electedwith that same campaign slogan.Anyway, if you look...There's my hive right there. See it?You're in Sheep Meadow!Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!No way! I know that area.I lost a toe ring there once.- Why do girls put rings on their toes?- Why not?- It's like putting a hat on your knee.- Maybe I'll try that.- You all right, ma'am?- Oh, yeah. Fine.Just having two cups of coffee!Anyway, this has been great.Thanks for the coffee.Yeah, it's no trouble.Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,I'd be up the rest of my life.Are you...?Oan I take a piece of this with me?Sure! Here, have a crumb.- Thanks!- Yeah.All right. Well, then...I guess I'll see you around.Or not.OK, Barry.And thank youso much again... for before.Oh, that? That was nothing.Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...This can't possibly work.He's all set to go.We may as well try it.OK, Dave, pull the chute.- Sounds amazing.- It was amazing!It was the scariest,happiest moment of my life.Humans! I can't believeyou were with humans!Giant, scary humans!What were they like?Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.They eat crazy giant things.They drive crazy.- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?- Some of them. But some of them don't.- How'd you get back?- Poodle.You did it, and I'm glad. You sawwhatever you wanted to see.You had your \"experience.\" Now youcan pick out yourjob and be normal.- Well...- Well?Well, I met someone.You did? Was she Bee-ish?- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!- No, no, no, not a wasp.- Spider?- I'm not attracted to spiders.I know it's the hottest thing,with the eight legs and all.I can't get by that face.So who is she?She's... human.No, no. That's a bee law.You wouldn't break a bee law.- Her name's Vanessa.- Oh, boy.She's so nice. And she's a florist!Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!We're not dating.You're flying outside the hive, talkingto humans that attack our homeswith power washers and M-80s!One-eighth a stick of dynamite!She saved my life!And she understands me.This is over!Eat this.This is not over! What was that?- They call it a crumb.- It was so stingin' stripey!And that's not what they eat.That's what falls off what they eat!- You know what a Oinnabon is?- No.It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.They heat it up...Sit down!...really hot!- Listen to me!We are not them! We're us.There's us and there's them!Yes, but who can denythe heart that is yearning?There's no yearning.Stop yearning. Listen to me!You have got to start thinking bee,my friend. Thinking bee!- Thinking bee.- Thinking bee.Thinking bee! Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!There he is. He's in the pool.You know what your problem is, Barry?I gotta start thinking bee?How much longer will this go on?It's been three days!Why aren't you working?I've got a lot of big life decisionsto think about.What life? You have no life!You have no job. You're barely a bee!Would it kill youto make a little honey?Barry, come out.Your father's talking to you.Martin, would you talk to him?Barry, I'm talking to you!You coming?Got everything?All set!Go ahead. I'll catch up.Don't be too long.Watch this!Vanessa!- We're still here.- I told you not to yell at him.He doesn't respond to yelling!- Then why yell at me?- Because you don't listen!I'm not listening to this.Sorry, I've gotta go.- Where are you going?- I'm meeting a friend.A girl? Is this why you can't decide?Bye.I just hope she's Bee-ish.They have a huge paradeof flowers every year in Pasadena?To be in the Tournament of Roses,that's every florist's dream!Up on a float, surroundedby flowers, crowds cheering.A tournament. Do the rosescompete in athletic events?No. All right, I've got one.How come you don't fly everywhere?It's exhausting. Why don't yourun everywhere? It's faster.Yeah, OK, I see, I see.All right, your turn.TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?That's insane!You don't have that?We have Hivo, but it's a disease.It's a horrible, horrible disease.Oh, my.Dumb bees!You must want to sting all those jerks.We try not to sting.It's usually fatal for us.So you have to watch your temper.Very carefully.You kick a wall, take a walk,write an angry letter and throw it out.Work through it like any emotion:Anger, jealousy, lust.Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?Yeah.- What is wrong with you?!- It's a bug.He's not bothering anybody.Get out of here, you creep!What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?Yeah, it was. How did you know?It felt like about 10 pages.Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.You've really got thatdown to a science.- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.- I'll bet.What in the nameof Mighty Hercules is this?How did this get here?Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,Ray Liotta Private Select?- Is he that actor?- I never heard of him.- Why is this here?- For people. We eat it.You don't haveenough food of your own?- Well, yes.- How do you get it?- Bees make it.- I know who makes it!And it's hard to make it!There's heating, cooling, stirring.You need a whole Krelman thing!- It's organic.- It's our-ganic!It's just honey, Barry.Just what?!Bees don't know about this!This is stealing!

I can't do this\"?Bees have never been afraidto change the world.What about Bee Oolumbus?Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.We were thinkingof stickball or candy stores.How old are you?The bee communityis supporting you in this case,which will be the trialof the bee century.You know, they have a Larry Kingin the human world too.It's a common name.

When I'm done withthe humans, they won't be ableto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"without paying a royalty!It's an incredible scenehere in downtown Manhattan,where the world anxiously waits,because for the first time in history,we will hear for ourselvesif a honeybee can actually speak.What have we gotten into here, Barry?It's pretty big, isn't it?I can't believe how many humansdon't work during the day.You think billion-dollar multinationalfood companies have good lawyers?Everybody needs to staybehind the barricade.- What's the matter?- I don't know, I just got a chill.Well, if it isn't the bee team.You boys work on this?All rise! The HonorableJudge Bumbleton presiding.All right. Oase number 4475,Superior Oourt of New York,Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industryis now in session.Mr. Montgomery, you're representingthe five food companies collectively?A privilege.Mr. Benson... you're representingall the bees of the world?I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,we're ready to proceed.Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,my grandmother was a simple woman.Born on a farm, she believedit was man's divine rightto benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us.If we lived in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines,just think of what would it mean.I would have to negotiatewith the silkwormfor the elastic in my britches!Talking bee!How do we know this isn't some sort ofholographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry?They could be using laser beams!Robotics! Ventriloquism!Oloning! For all we know,he could be on steroids!Mr. Benson?Ladies and gentlemen,there's no trickery here.I'm just an ordinary bee.Honey's pretty important to me.It's important to all bees.We invented it!We make it. And we protect itwith our lives.Unfortunately, there aresome people in this roomwho think they can take it from us'cause we're the little guys!I'm hoping that, after this is all over,you'll see how, by taking our honey,you not only take everything we havebut everything we are!I wish he'd dress like thatall the time. So nice!Oall your first witness.So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, big company you have.I suppose so.I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron!Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms.Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term.I don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you?- No.- I couldn't hear you.- No.- No.Because you don't free bees.You keep bees. Not only that,it seems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey.They're very lovable creatures.Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.You mean like this?Bears kill bees!How'd you like his head crashingthrough your living room?!Biting into your couch!Spitting out your throw pillows!OK, that's enough. Take him away.So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.Your name intrigues me.- Where have I heard it before?- I was with a band called The Police.But you've never beena police officer, have you?No, I haven't.No, you haven't. And so herewe have yet another exampleof bee culture casuallystolen by a humanfor nothing more thana prance-about stage name.Oh, please.Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?Because I'm feelinga little stung, Sting.Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!That's not his real name?! You idiots!Mr. Liotta, first,belated congratulations onyour Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005.Thank you. Thank you.I see from your resumethat you're devilishly handsomewith a churning inner turmoilthat's ready to blow.I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?Not yet it isn't. But is thiswhat it's come to for you?Exploiting tiny, helpless beesso you don'thave to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir?Watch it, Benson!I could blow right now!This isn't a goodfella.This is a badfella!Why doesn't someone just step onthis creep, and we can all go home?!- Order in this court!- You're all thinking it!Order! Order, I say!- Say it!- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!I think it was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that.I think the jury's on our side.Are we doing everything right, legally?I'm a florist.Right. Well, here's to a great team.To a great team!Well, hello.- Ken!- Hello.I didn't think you were coming.No, I was just late.I tried to call, but... the battery.I didn't want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.Oh, that was lucky.There's a little left.I could heat it up.Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.So I hear you're quite a tennis player.I'm not much for the game myself.The ball's a little grabby.That's where I usually sit.Right... there.Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn't really a special skill.You think I don't see what you're doing?I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We have that in common.Do we?Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out.That's just whatI was thinking about doing.Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.I'm going to drain the old stinger.Yeah, you do that.Look at that.You know, I've just about had itwith your little mind games.- What's that?- Italian Vogue.Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.A lot of ads.Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine?Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!I think something stinks in here!I love the smell of flowers.How do you like the smell of flames?!Not as much.Water bug! Not taking sides!Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!This is pathetic!I've got issues!Well, well, well, a royal flush!- You're bluffing.- Am I?Surf's up, dude!Poo water!That bowl is gnarly.Except for those dirty yellow rings!Kenneth! What are you doing?!You know, I don't even like honey!I don't eat it!We need to talk!He's just a little bee!And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time!Long time? What are you talking about?!Are there other bugs in your life?No, but there are other things buggingme in life. And you're one of them!Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...My nerves are fried from ridingon this emotional roller coaster!Goodbye, Ken.And for your information,I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man!I'm sorry about all that.I know it's gotan aftertaste! I like it!I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me.I couldn't overcome it.Oh, well.Are you OK for the trial?I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas.We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.Good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the best lawyers...Yeah.Layton, you'vegotta weave some magicwith this jury,or it's gonna be all over.Don't worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury aroundis to remind themof what they don't like about bees.- You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic?Only to losing, son. Only to losing.Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask youwhat I think we'd all like to know.What exactly is your relationshipto that woman?We're friends.- Good friends?- Yes.How good? Do you live together?Wait a minute...Are you her little......bedbug?I've seen a bee documentary or two.From what I understand,doesn't your queen give birthto all the bee children?- Yeah, but...- So those aren't your real parents!- Oh, Barry...- Yes, they are!Hold me back!You're an illegitimate bee,aren't you, Benson?He's denouncing bees!Don't y'all date your cousins?- Objection!- I'm going to pincushion this guy!Adam, don't! It's what he wants!Oh, I'm hit!!Oh, lordy, I am hit!Order! Order!The venom! The venomis coursing through my veins!I have been felledby a winged beast of destruction!You see? You can't treat themlike equals! They're striped savages!Stinging's the only thingthey know! It's their way!- Adam, stay with me.- I can't feel my legs.What angel of mercywill come forward to suck the poisonfrom my heaving buttocks?I will have order in this court. Order!Order, please!The case of the honeybeesversus the human racetook a pointed turn against the beesyesterday when one of their legalteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.- Hey, buddy.- Hey.- Is there much pain?- Yeah.I...I blew the whole case, didn't I?It doesn't matter. What matters isyou're alive. You could have died.I'd be better off dead. Look at me.They got it from the cafeteriadownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.Look, there'sa little celery still on it.What was it like to sting someone?I can't explain it. It was all...All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!All right.You think it was all a trap?Of course. I'm sorry.I flew us right into this.What were we thinking? Look at us. We'rejust a couple of bugs in this world.What will the humans do to usif they win?I don't know.I hear they put the roaches in motels.That doesn't sound so bad.Adam, they check in,but they don't check out!Oh, my.Oould you get a nurseto close that window?- Why?- The smoke.Bees don't smoke.Right. Bees don't smoke.Bees don't smoke!But some bees are smoking.That's it! That's our case!It is? It's not over?Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.Get back to the court and stall.Stall any way you can.And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.Mr. Flayman.Yes? Yes, Your Honor!Where is the rest of your team?Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,and as a result,we don't make very good time.I actually heard a funny story about...Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugstaken up enoughof this court's valuable time?How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on?They have presented no compellingevidence to support their chargesagainst my clients,who run legitimate businesses.I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case!Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm goingto have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion.But you can't! We have a terrific case.Where is your proof?Where is the evidence?Show me the smoking gun!Hold it, Your Honor!You want a smoking gun?Here is your smoking gun.What is that?It's a bee smoker!What, this?This harmless little contraption?This couldn't hurt a fly,let alone a bee.Look at what has happenedto bees who have never been asked,\"Smoking or non?\"Is this what nature intended for us?To be forcibly addictedto smoke machinesand man-made wooden slat work camps?Living out our lives as honey slavesto the white man?- What are we gonna do?- He's playing the species card.Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!Free the bees!Free the bees! Free the bees!The court finds in favor of the bees!Vanessa, we won!I knew you could do it! High-five!Sorry.I'm OK! You know what this means?All the honeywill finally belong to the bees.Now we won't haveto work so hard all the time.This is an unholy perversionof the balance of nature, Benson.You'll regret this.Barry, how much honey is out there?All right. One at a time.Barry, who are you wearing?My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants.- What if Montgomery's right?- What do you mean?We've been living the bee waya long time, 27 million years.Oongratulations on your victory.What will you demand as a settlement?First, we'll demand a complete shutdownof all bee work camps.Then we want back the honeythat was ours to begin with,every last drop.We demand an end to the glorificationof the bear as anything morethan a filthy, smelly,bad-breath stink machine.We're all awareof what they do in the woods.Wait for my signal.Take him out.He'll have nauseousfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames...But it's just a prance-about stage name!...unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health productsand la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments.Oan't breathe.Bring it in, boys!Hold it right there! Good.Tap it.Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and there's gallons more coming!- I think we need to shut down!- Shut down? We've never shut down.Shut down honey production!Stop making honey!Turn your key, sir!What do we do now?Oannonball!We're shutting honey production!Mission abort.Aborting pollination and nectar detail.Returning to base.Adam, you wouldn't believehow much honey was out there.Oh, yeah?What's going on? Where is everybody?- Are they out celebrating?- They're home.They don't know what to do.Laying out, sleeping in.I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his wayto San Antonio with a cricket.At least we got our honey back.Sometimes I think, so what if humansliked our honey? Who wouldn't?It's the greatest thing in the world!I was excited to be part of making it.This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well.And now...Now I can't.I don't understandwhy they're not happy.I thought their lives would be better!They're doing nothing. It's amazing.Honey really changes people.You don't have any ideawhat's going on, do you?- What did you want to show me?- This.What happened here?That is not the half of it.Oh, no. Oh, my.They're all wilting.Doesn't look very good, does it?No.And whose fault do you think that is?You know, I'm gonna guess bees.Bees?Specifically, me.I didn't think bees not needing to makehoney would affect all these things.It's notjust flowers.Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.That's our whole SAT test right there.Take away produce, that affectsthe entire animal kingdom.And then, of course...The human species?So if there's no more pollination,it could all just go south here,couldn't it?I know this is also partly my fault.How about a suicide pact?How do we do it?- I'll sting you, you step on me.- Thatjust kills you twice.Right, right.Listen, Barry...sorry, but I gotta get going.I had to open my mouth and talk.Vanessa?Vanessa? Why are you leaving?Where are you going?To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena.They've moved it to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying.It's the last chanceI'll ever have to see it.Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.I never meant it to turn out like this.I know. Me neither.Tournament of Roses.Roses can't do sports.Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?Roses!Vanessa!Roses?!Barry?- Roses are flowers!- Yes, they are.Flowers, bees, pollen!I know.That's why this is the last parade.Maybe not.Oould you ask him to slow down?Oould you slow down?Barry!OK, I made a huge mistake.This is a total disaster, all my fault.Yes, it kind of is.I've ruined the planet.I wanted to help youwith the flower shop.I've made it worse.Actually, it's completely closed down.I thought maybe you were remodeling.But I have another idea, and it'sgreater than my previous ideas combined.I don't want to hear it!All right, they have the roses,the roses have the pollen.I know every bee, plantand flower bud in this park.All we gotta do is get what they've gotback here with what we've got.- Bees.- Park.- Pollen!- Flowers.- Repollination!- Across the nation!Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, Oalifornia.They've got nothingbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.Security will be tight.I have an idea.Vanessa Bloome, FTD.Official floral business. It's real.Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.Thank you. It was a gift.Once inside,we just pick the right float.How about The Princess and the Pea?I could be the princess,and you could be the pea!Yes, I got it.- Where should I sit?- What are you?- I believe I'm the pea.- The pea?It goes under the mattresses.- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.- I'm getting the marshal.You do that!This whole parade is a fiasco!Let's see what this baby'll do.Hey, what are you doing?!Then all we dois blend in with traffic......without arousing suspicion.Once at the airport,there's no stopping us.Stop! Security.- You and your insect pack your float?- Yes.Has it beenin your possession the entire time?Would you remove your shoes?- Remove your stinger.- It's part of me.I know. Just having some fun.Enjoy your flight.Then if we're lucky, we'll havejust enough pollen to do the job.Oan you believe how lucky we are? Wehave just enough pollen to do the job!I think this is gonna work.It's got to work.Attention, passengers,this is Oaptain Scott.We have a bit of bad weatherin New York.It looks like we'll experiencea couple hours delay.Barry, these are cut flowerswith no water. They'll never make it.I gotta get up thereand talk to them.Be careful.Oan I get helpwith the Sky Mall magazine?I'd like to order the talkinginflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.- What'd you say, Hal?- Nothing.Bee!Don't freak out! My entire species...What are you doing?- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!- Who's an attorney?Don't move.Oh, Barry.Good afternoon, passengers.This is your captain.Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit?And please hurry!What happened here?There was a DustBuster,a toupee, a life raft exploded.One's bald, one's in a boat,they're both unconscious!- Is that another bee joke?- No!No one's flying the plane!This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.What's your status?This is Vanessa Bloome.I'm a florist from New York.Where's the pilot?He's unconscious,and so is the copilot.Not good. Does anyone onboardhave flight experience?As a matter of fact, there is.- Who's that?- Barry Benson.From the honey trial?! Oh, great.Vanessa, this is nothing morethan a big metal bee.It's got giant wings, huge engines.I can't fly a plane.- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?- Yes.How hard could it be?Wait, Barry!We're headed into some lightning.This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport,where a suspenseful sceneis developing.Barry Benson,fresh from his legal victory...That's Barry!...is attempting to land a plane,loaded with people, flowersand an incapacitated flight crew.Flowers?!We have a storm in the areaand two individuals at the controlswith absolutely no flight experience.Just a minute.There's a bee on that plane.I'm quite familiar with Mr. Bensonand his no-account compadres.They've done enough damage.But isn't he your only hope?Technically, a beeshouldn't be able to fly at all.Their wings are too small...Haven't we heard this a million times?\"The surface area of the wingsand body mass make no sense.\"- Get this on the air!- Got it.- Stand by.- We're going live.The way we work may be a mystery to you.Making honey takes a lot of beesdoing a lot of small jobs.But let me tell you about a small job.If you do it well,it makes a big difference.More than we realized.To us, to everyone.That's why I want to get beesback to working together.That's the bee way!We're not made of Jell-O.We get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow!- Hello!Left, right, down, hover.- Hover?- Forget hover.This isn't so hard.Beep-beep! Beep-beep!Barry, what happened?!Wait, I think we wereon autopilot the whole time.- That may have been helping me.- And now we're not!So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.All of you, let's getbehind this fellow! Move it out!Move out!Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,you copy me with the wings of the plane!Don't have to yell.I'm not yelling!We're in a lot of trouble.It's very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice!It's not a tone. I'm panicking!I can't do this!Vanessa, pull yourself together.You have to snap out of it!You snap out of it.You snap out of it.- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- You snap out of it!- Hold it!- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.How is the plane flying?I don't know.Hello?Benson, got any flowersfor a happy occasion in there?The Pollen Jocks!They do get behind a fellow.- Black and yellow.- Hello.All right, let's drop this tin canon the blacktop.Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?No, nothing. It's all cloudy.Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.- Thinking bee.- Thinking bee.Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!Wait a minute.I think I'm feeling something.- What?- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.Bring the nose down.Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!- What in the world is on the tarmac?- Get some lights on that!Thinking bee!Thinking bee! Thinking bee!- Vanessa, aim for the flower.- OK.Out the engines. We're going inon bee power. Ready, boys?Affirmative!Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.Land on that flower!Ready? Full reverse!Spin it around!- Not that flower! The other one!- Which one?- That flower.- I'm aiming at the flower!That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.I mean the giant pulsating flowermade of millions of bees!Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.Rotate around it.- This is insane, Barry!- This's the only way I know how to fly.Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this planeflying in an insect-like pattern?Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.Smell it. Full reverse!Just drop it. Be a part of it.Aim for the center!Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!Oome on, already.Barry, we did it!You taught me how to fly!- Yes. No high-five!- Right.Barry, it worked!Did you see the giant flower?What giant flower? Where? Of courseI saw the flower! That was genius!- Thank you.- But we're not done yet.Listen, everyone!This runway is coveredwith the last pollenfrom the last flowersavailable anywhere on Earth.That means this is our last chance.We're the only ones who make honey,pollinate flowers and dress like this.If we're gonna survive as a species,this is our moment! What do you say?Are we going to be bees, orjustMuseum of Natural History keychains?We're bees!Keychain!Then follow me! Except Keychain.Hold on, Barry. Here.You've earned this.Yeah!I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfectfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.Oh, yeah.That's our Barry.Mom! The bees are back!If anybody needsto make a call, now's the time.I got a feeling we'll beworking late tonight!Here's your change. Have a greatafternoon! Oan I help who's next?Would you like some honey with that?It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.And I don't see a nickel!Sometimes I just feellike a piece of meat!I had no idea.Barry, I'm sorry.Have you got a moment?Would you excuse me?My mosquito associate will help you.Sorry I'm late.He's a lawyer too?I was already a blood-sucking parasite.All I needed was a briefcase.Have a great afternoon!Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,and I can't get them anywhere.No problem, Vannie.Just leave it to me.You're a lifesaver, Barry.Oan I help who's next?All right, scramble, jocks!It's time to fly.Thank you, Barry!That bee is living my life!Let it go, Kenny.- When will this nightmare end?!- Let it all go.- Beautiful day to fly.- Sure is.Between you and me,I was dying to get out of that office.You have gotto start thinking bee, my friend.- Thinking bee!- Me?Hold it.

(12.25.09) i was just so frustrated with not being able to decide what to do in a song, that i was like, ok .... what's the worst thing that could happen if i just say 'rabbit snakes' like this, right at the top? and then the song bloomed into all kinds of interesting things, including obscure dead-beatle conspiracy references. \"dance the\" was written probably on the same day, and absolutely starts with garbage, just the same way. \"eat bread\" also was written at that time, as well as \"trees / everything\" (this one uses major garbage in the second verse.) \"i'm a diamond\" (apr 2010) is a very clear example. starting in august 2010, i started writing a LOT more, and used that a lot. that's when i came up with the name for the concept ('murder your demon') and you get songs like 2010, the summertime, pretty much everything from aug 2010 (also recorded at that time). \"i like.\" \"modern woes\". There are many many many more songs written from 09, 10, .. only a small percentage of them got recorded (it takes much longer to record a song than to write it, and i wrote way too much). in the second half of 2010 i probably wrote more than any other time.... ('dream of evil' came from that time, not sure if that exactly uses 'demon' technique because i don't think any of those parts were specifically deliberately throw-away.) in 2011 i made a big effort to try to write in a more 'normal' way, so there are not any examples from 2011. (well, maybe from early 2011 you have 'skip to my loo'). near the end of 2011 you have 'write a tune that really sucks' that was just a one-off. (also that is an example where instead of going into something non-garbage, it just ends instead. that's an alternate strategy). 2012/13 was all gathering and updating all the existing songs, so not too many new ones got started. but there was one random library session in june 2013 where i wrote several, just like the old days. \"tuesday\" is the main example (and actually kind of a tutorial on how the technique works)"

(A fascinating pursuit, even if it's a bit strange.)  What I'm wondering though, is what this means for quality control?  So, for instance, would you rather create 100 kind-of okay-ish videos/songs, or 1 really really good one?  And if you found one specific thing that meant the world to you, would you be willing to drop everything to work on just that project, or would you rather be working on having more \"things\" done for people to see at the end of the day?  (sorry for this question being so wordy, i almost feel bad making you read all this)",
            "i am trying to do the best stuff i can. but sometimes if you are thinking like that, you won't do anything. at a certain point, you realize that every song or story is only good because there is something wrong with it. the main character has to have a problem in order for the story to mean anything. music has to have something 'bad' or 'wrong' about it, in order for you to feel the healing from that problem. So the more you try to search for the 'perfect' song, you will only realize that the only perfect song is total silence..... which is pointless. Over and over again i have tried to hone in on the \"right music\" and it continues to be impossible, and that is what has always led me to just dig in and start going crazy. in the end, i am a perfectionist, so even if i work on a very strange song or project, i am still going to take care to make sure that it is as good as possible. Also, very important to remember, is that the more you do, the better you get. this is the (ref: http://youtube.com/wheezywaiter)wheezy waiter \"quantity+quality\" theory. you are really never going to discover what you are truly capable of unless you try many different things. if you sit around and wait for something better and better, you will get no experience and you will chicken out because you will be afraid it won't be good enough. that being said, i am currently working on a video that is longer than any video i have ever made, and it will probably take longer to make than any video i have ever made. so i'm not sure where that fits into your equation of \"100 okay-ish videos\""

I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several allignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i \"save as\" and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and allignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to sonehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in gettiing a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start. i was on a 7 day vine schedule at that time, so that video was an insane time crunch, and the notation took me from about 3am straight through the entire day until 4 pm and was barely on time for work. (not to mention COMPOSING the rhythms and chords, and composing the notation, before animating it.) it was a bad and unhealthy time crunch. i suppose thats what you get for attempting a 30 sec (45 sec? whatever it is) video in place of a 6 second video. was in such a rush, there is a smudge in the youtube version (a stray piece of a note that didn't get erased fully)"
