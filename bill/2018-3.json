But whether we're happy or sad, home is home. Now, if our next chord is what we expect it to be, using a lot of the same notes as the first chord, then that's not much of an adventure. but if all of the sudden we're playing very unexpected notes, that can have this otherworldly vibe. i discovered this by playing a D minor chord followed by a B major. because I've already played the D and the F without making it sharp or flat, you really wouldnt expect me to flip it on it's head and make both the D and the F sharp. so it feels like we've learned something new and extraordinary, especially because the B is Major compared to the unhappy minorness of home. a m i gett ing somewhere?",

            "Hi Bill,\nMy ex-girlfriend and I broke up (we're still good friends though). She said that I became more awkward around her in person and she didn't want to ruin our relationship. I told her that I completely understood, but in all honesty, I hate myself for fucking up what we had together. I don't know why I became so awkward around her in person, and it really irritates me that I messed up with her, because I really did love her. I just didn't want to come off as clingy and weird in public. I'm kind of a shy and quiet person most of the time, and it takes me a while to warm up to someone and show them the real me. The only reason I didn't show her the love and affection that she deserved in public is because we only really see each other in school, and I didn't want anyone looking at me strangely. I get embarrassed and nervous easily, and I would have been panicking in my head if people looked and laughed at me while I was being affectionate t owards h er. The real issue here is that I still have feelings for her. I miss what we had together. I want to try again and be less awkward around her, but I feel like she'll turn me down this time because she might find someone else or I might fuck it up again. I don't know if I'll ever find a girl like her again. I feel like a hopeless piece of shit. What do I do to make myself feel better in a time like this?

I wrote it a long time ago (well not so long if we're using geological scale) and never really payed any attention to it, but one time one musician heard it's unfinished version and said that it is a very great song, and a very lame performance. As I am clinically crazy, I started to work on it from the beginning and saw it's \"true\" potential. It's a song about trying to escape from reality by going, walking far away. Walking home, searching home.\n\nBut I can't make it right. Right now it is almost 8 minutes long, and boring for everybody but me.\nKind mister, please advice me. How to make those 8 minutes The Eight Minutes?",

F# as a note would be much more common than Gb because F# is the first note to go, in sharp keys. where as in flat keys Gb is is the 5th note to go. so people are already more accustomed to verbally hearing the words \"F#\" than Gb",

That would be like if you had a camera that saved every picture as \"picture\" by default, and it wiped out any previous picture named 'picture' every time you took a picture without re-naming it. so not only do you have to name your picture every time but you have to remember all the names you've ever used, so as to not risk deleting a picture. i searched and searched and i could not find an explanation for why the program is this way, or just simply how you would go about this without living in a state of mind fucktastrophy. oh and by the way there's no save dialog and it's easy to quit accidentally. so there's that too"

            "Have you ever used one of those sinks where you turn the tap ever so carefully and slowly, it budges just a tiny bit and water just explodes out of the faucet, spraying everywhere and making a huge mess? Well, that's the story of my life right now. I have so many ideas and directions I want to go with music that I can't get anything done. Like, the other week I was listening to prelude to the afternoon of a faun and I was thinking how I'd love to learn orchestration and arranging and write these beautiful, epic symphonic poems. But I also LOVE prince and p funk and james brown, and I want to just devote my life to making the funkiest music ever. But I'll watch some of your videos and I love your score-writing and how you sync up music and visuals so well and how that's such a powerful tool and it makes me want to learn animation and video-making. But then I listened to some paul simon, and it's like, maybe I just want to get my acoustic guitar and ju st write  some nice songs. Then I'll hear some top 40 radio and it makes me want to write really fun, upbeat, catchy bubblegum-y tunes. But my first love, the thing that made me want to be a musician was blues, and there's always a part of me that just wants to just be a blues guy... I can go on forever and write a novel about the music I want to make, and I'm being pulled in so many different directions. I'll get really motivated to do something, until I have another idea that makes me pull a 360 and want to do something entirely different. I have all these lofty goals and dreams and things I want to accomplish, but I can't stop time and do everything all at once. More than anything I want to be PROLIFIC. I want a vast library of music. But I can't commit to any one thing because nothing stands out above the rest for what direction I want to go, and what I want to devote myself too. My compass is spinning around. I'll sit at the piano or pick up my guitar to write and can't even foc us on on e thing for more than a few minutes. I'll start working on one thing, and then without even thinking, my brain switches gears and I'll be trying to do something entirely different. Every time I turn on that sink to fill my cup, the water gushes all over the place and I drop the cup and it shatters and I'm left with a spray of water everywhere, but no water in my cup to drink (or to give to others to drink). I've taken a page out of your book and have been really serious about documenting and recording every idea so nothing falls through the cracks... But I just don't know what to do next. Do you have any advice you can share with me? I'm about to explode.",
